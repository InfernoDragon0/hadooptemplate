Everyone's returned to their offices.
"It's significantly more contagious than BA.1, roughly doubling weekly everywhere *relatively*.  This is a problem for places that have faced it without a BA.1 surge before, such as Hong Kong, Denmark, New Zealand, South Korea, and China.  Though many of those places have a very high rate of third doses so then it's no problem.It doesn't seem to be any more severe than BA.1, though this isn't certain yet (it does make sense genetically, since there's only one mutation in the RBD).  In places that mitigated their BA.1 surge significantly (western Europe), there's a lot of susceptible people still and a large rolling BA.2 wave would be expected.  In places that let BA.1 rip, like the US and South Africa, herd immunity would have been overshot much more and there may not be a BA.2 surge at all. Immunity works strongly between the two.Going forward BA.1 is irrelevant and doomed for extinction.  Only BA.2 (and maybe eventually Delta+ or some future new strain) matter."
"There's no reason to freak out *yet*. Maybe there will be in the future, maybe not."
"Depends on where you live and how old you are.  In the US you?ll be able to re-boost soon if you?re over 50, rumor is that they will announce this next week.  I expect it?ll be the honor system at walgreens and such if you want one while younger - just say that you?re immunocompromised. Some other countries, like Israel, already offer them."
I also haven't seen mine since 2020... whenever Covid is ok here it's bad there and vice-versa. And both of them are at risk. It's been difficult.
Two years in and my brother in Samoa still hasn't been in the same city as an active case.
"The unemployment was wild. I kind of enjoyed it for a week or two. Felt like we were all coming together and sacrificing a bit. Then it just kept dragging on and on. Time and calendars lost meaning. Thank god the state UI system required me to log in every two weeks and claim my payment, that was the only thing that kept me grounded to the days of the week lol. It wasn?t all torturous; I learned to ride a motorcycle and reconciled with an ex. But I?d prefer not to go through that again in my life."
Right? I lived alone and worked from home at the beginning of this.  The isolation was borderline unbearable.  I didn't see another human being I knew for almost 6 months.  If I didn't have D&D as a way of socializing online I would have legit gone crazy
"I quit my job end of 2019, fully prepared for a several month leave after working in engineering for over 20 years. Company completely swapped in new management, who treated the employees like shit, let half our salaried workers go. Half of the remaining ones they gave you an instant ultimatum to transplant to another facility or lose your job. I got such an ""offer"". I was already burned out being a single parent, and I couldn't commute 160 mile round trip every day to the new ""opportunity"" facility. Ironically I proposed a request for WFH instead, because my job didn't need me to be in the office 90% of the time. They denied it, so I quit, and a few months later COVID hit. SMH.I have been out of work since, other than some odd pocket money things I've done since kids schooling from home, and haven't been able to get them back into school since, so also can't find any meaningful work. I'd love WFH, but finding a job isn't as easy as some people think it is, especially when you still have to manage two grade school kids during the day who are also schooling from home."
"I kept working through the early pandemic (private practice physician), so the undercurrent of dread, while still trying to make sense of the data coming in, while also keeping a strong face for my patients, really accentuated that 'you can't fail or show any weakness.'  I think I adapted by shutting down my emotions.  I'm not sure I've reconnected to them, but I've managed to keep my clinic open and my staff employed/paid and overall healthy.  The dread hasn't left.  I'm still not sure if I'm 'permitted' to feel or do normal human things.  Some of my friends were posting things about 'finding themselves' with their time off, but it was just a bunch of unknowns, and the stress of keeping a business open 24/7.  I did do a lot of abstract painting, and kept working on my sobriety (no slips, even with the terror!) but yeah it felt like a pause on life that I haven't quite restarted from.  Things won't be the same again."
I feel this. I was 8 months pregnant with my first. My income was gone. I didn?t know if I was going to give birth alone. I couldn?t see my family. I was diagnosed with gestational diabetes and foods I needed were limited. Then I got sick and couldn?t get access to testing. It was a terrifying time for me.
"I?m sorry you lost your job and it was traumatic & terrible. For a lot of people whose work went remote, it was still scary, but at least the burden of commuting was lifted. I definitely felt anxious about the whole thing, but relived I could stay home and not be around people (huge bonus for someone introverted!) I also liked that there were no more social obligations and my time felt like my own for the first time in my life. It was a weird feeling but not all bad. I also liked that there was more emphasis on nature and just being outside vs indoors and going out to spend money. It was scary and I was terrified for my elderly relatives but it wasn?t all terrible so I understand people romanticizing it."
Agree. I will never watch any of those stupid romantic comedies about lockdown. Nothing fun or cute about them at time period at all. Also got love the people who were locked down for 2 weeks and then never thought of covid again. These are the people who refer to the pandemic as spring of 2020 only and then after that went on with their lives.
"I have immense nostalgia for late 2019, pre-march 2020. Everything after that was a slow realization that the US government doesn?t care about its citizens and most citizens don?t care about each other. Two solid years of trauma for so many."
Same dude. We had a terrible bout of covid in the house in early April 2020 that put my husband in the hospital. Seeing it painted as this romantic time to reflect is just so strange.
"It's a twilight zone feeling, it feels fictional. It was such an immediate, seismic stop to the world. It changed everything for everyone and that's underselling it. I feel like we've all been through whiplash.The consequences are already huge, it's going to be increasingly insane to see the ramifications in the future looking in hindsight.While it feels more ""normalized"" now, I think the mental impact is beyond our comprehension right now. I feel like the world is very much still in shock."
Yeah with the whole wfh thing it was eye opening to see who had a nice office to work from at home and who didnt and instead worked out of a little corner in their bedroom (or studio apartment). Or who had second or third houses and retreats to work from in other towns and states
"Hi I just wanted to let you know I read what has happened to you and I?m so so sorry for what you have gone through, and are still enduring. <333"
"We washed the groceries once. I saw that YouTube video that everyone else also saw about how you should wipe down all the groceries and take the inside bags out of boxed cereal and whatnot. I enlisted my kids and we spent half an hour wiping down and separating and disinfecting.Afterward I was like, I don't care how risky it is, we're not doing this again."
"I remember long lines of people waiting for their turn to get into Walmart and Home Depot. I remember one-way aisles once you got into the stores. I remember Michigan not allowing the sale of ""non-essential"" items like plant seeds and spray paint. I remember seeing playgrounds closed off with yellow caution tape."
"I don't regret doing that, we had almost no knowledge of how it spreads or how to properly avoid it in the early days, so I think it was a fair thing to do."
Sometimes I?ll randomly come across a comment of someone still doing it and it?s like a time machine
We will never do shoes in the house again. The floors are so much cleaner when we leave them at the door. I can only imagine what we were bringing in from the city streets
"Reminds me when everyone was panicked about toilet paper and caused a shortage because everyone was caught between ""don't buy more than you need"" and ""there might not be any left for you"""
I remember clapping and cheering for the essential workers everynight. I believe essential workers deserve a holiday (or two). The amount that I needed the people (not just over the last 2 years) is a lot more than I've appreciated before.
"This is really heartening to hear! I?ve been wondering if society is moving on while healthcare workers are left fucked, and I?m glad to hear we?re in a (relatively) good spot for the moment. Hopefully omi 2.0 doesn?t mess that up."
"...and I personally have pretty much lost a large amount of faith in people in general due to the divide, general ignorance and such surrounding the pandemic."
"I feel the same, traumatized by it.  I already had no faith in humanity from the other issues I have dealt with.The political divide will always be there.  No matter what.  Just a new thing to exploit.  Same actors too.  They demonized race, they demonized sexual orientation, demonizing masks was easy."
"The minute I heard the words ""this is their new hoax"", I knew this country was going to be in for a very rough ride."
English is not your first language? This was wonderfully written! You said it quite well and it really resonated with how I felt all of too. ??
"My health situation sounds so much like yours and my reality now sounds a lot like yours. I just have lost a certain amount of hope and faith in people. I've hated myself for being sick. I've become very proud of myself for being level headed and surviving this so far. But every day of my life I feel this shift, knowing I may never get my old life back and the people who force me inside are proclaiming victory and victimhood simultaneously and it is a feeling I can't ever forget. And the worst is how many of them are family."
"Omg yes that was horrifying! Thinking back now, I wonder why that happened? We know now that people don?t just drop dead / faint like that due to Covid (right?)?"
"Same. I was in my final year at the Uni in 2020, graduated in 2021 and started by first job. It seems,that these two years have passed in a jiffy and I spent most of my time isolated and cut off from my peer group,barely meeting anyone. It's as if ? the world has rushed and I am still in a standstill. 2020,2021 and now 2022. It seems around ~ 2 years of my life has just passed away and I barely could feel it."
">I think that the advances in virology and immunology that have and will occur because of this will be amazing. Oh, and new vaccine tech that can be leveraged for other viruses as well as to deliver new treatments for hitherto untreatable conditions. Also telemedicine? Isn?t that great for uncomplicated problems?These innovations were accelerated purely because of the pandemic and will change humanity for the better, improving the lives of billions going forward. The development (and timeline) of the mRNA vaccines is arguably one of the most important medical innovations in human history."
"Yes to all of this. It also really helped me appreciate the smaller things in life. My 2020 plans included trips to Germany, Canada, and San Diego. I had to settle for a summer of exploring local parks and forests instead and it made me appreciate the area I live in so much more and realize I don?t need to take a big trip to feel like I?ve had a productive and fun summer. Also looking back I really appreciated being forced to have a very intimate and small Thanksgiving and Christmas in 2020. It made me realize the meaning of those holidays more than I had in previous years."
I love being able to preorder my groceries for delivery or pickup via an app service.
"Thanks so much for this comment. Having lost someone during COVID, and lost a lot of enjoyment and celebrations of my own, some positivity out of this is lovely."
I remember getting my first shot and it was like a party atmosphere. Everyone was cheering and celebrating. The woman next to me hugged the person who gave her the shot and it was just so so so exciting
"This is crazy because I could have written almost exactly the same thing that you so eloquently just did. I?m a teacher and any time there is a ?Friday the 13th? the kids act a little crazy, and 3/13/20 was no different. I remember after school we had a HUGE Happy Hour and basically every teacher from my school went. We all watched the news in the bar wondering if we were REALLY going to be closed for 2 weeks. Then, with the 2 weeks to flatten the curve, everything hit the fan. At that point we did NOT have remote work capabilities because I work for a title 9 school and the majority of students at my school didn?t even have internet at home. It was so incredibly isolating. What?s crazy is I was also in the first round of vaccines, a week before my birthday as well! Despite that, I had Covid before the vaccine and actually again right now, even though I?m boosted and I?m living with long Covid. Summer hit and I ALSO took a trip to Orlando, I used to work at Disney so it?s always a fun time to visit old friends for the weekend and I truly thought we were close to getting back to ?normal? Then obviously delta hit and the school year started off completely virtual for the first 6 months. That was tough. And now through strange life events I?m living in Europe and all anyone can talk about Ukraine, and it feels like Covid is disappearing from the news, but not from our lives. It?s really crazy to me how our stories are so similar and yet I don?t know you at all, Internet stranger. It brings me a little comfort knowing that another human has gone through something so similar. Here?s to hoping 2022 gets better!"
That was the day it hit the fan. The Rudy Goebert microphone day. That was the worst day.
"Yeah the NBA canceling the 2020 season was the turning point for me when shit got serious. The videos of body bags in NY came shortly later, but the NBA for me was when it became real"
"I'm so sorry for your loss. It's got to be awful to be grieving so many losses, while simultaneously being cut off from the world (another kind of loss). I really hope they find more treatments that allow you to feel you can return to the world with limited risk."
"I?ve learned that there is an expiration date on people willing to do the right thing. Given the opportunity to do the right thing, most will but only until they feel inconvenienced."
"I think it can be done, the world has shown an incredible amount of unity for Ukraine."
"I work in EMS, and ngl, I?d probably end up bitter anyway. The pandemic simply accelerated it to the point that I have the same bitterness as a 19 year vet about to retire instead of a guy with 5 years"
"Thank you for what you do and have done. I don?t blame you for feeling bitter. But I?m sure your efforts have convinced at least a few to get the vaccine when they previously wouldn?t have without your encouragement, and even if they don?t appreciate it, I know their loved ones do. So thank you."
"I'm an established private practice physician and one bitterness I have is experiencing this strange science-phobia/science distrust that was always a bit present right before the pandemic (Dr. Google and Insta-doc-moms), magnified and focused in a political way.  It's hard enough to do what we do and try to help convince our patients to make decisions to better their health, but now I feel like I'm fighting that politicization on a daily basis.  There are some quality measures that require I ask about vaccination, and I try to do what you have which is moving on, when I can, but still there are times when it's a soapbox and/or awkward friction arises.I don't know what field you're going into, but you have my well-wishes that you can find some steadiness and something grounding for yourself and optimism.  I hope for some type of shift over the next few years so that in some ways, the general populace can start to trust and believe in science again.  I always felt that one of the United States' strengths was its scientific advancements and sense of 'we're in this together' but I certainly don't feel that as much now.  This feeling of divisiveness is somewhat off-putting enough that I find myself waking up and going 'is what I'm doing worth it?  Can I keep at this for years to come?'Medicine is in such a strange place.  That being said - I still am grateful for the privilege to try to help others in what way I can, and when I feel particularly unsettled I try to step back, take some deep breaths, and reframe, trying to let go of the weird interactions and remember that I can approach each new encounter with an open mind and hope."
You can't take responsibility for your patient's choices. You give them your best advice and they will do what they want with that. It's not on you. Don't torture yourself with their ignorance and stubbornness.
NO thank you doctor! I don?t believe in putting things I don?t know in my body. Now hurry the fuck up with my heartburn medication so I can go jam processed food dyes into my fat fucking gullet.
"The ignorance doesn?t end. It might be covid issues now, but it is always something. Smoking, alcohol, drugs, obesity, medication non-compliance, or any other way that people willingly make poor health choices."
Totally understand what you?re saying but I want to add that the anti vax people I know all say their doctors don?t even mention the covid vaccine or try to push it at all which just reinforces their antivax rhetoric. I imagine it?s exhausting but I wish doctors would still at least mention how stupid it is to be unvaccinated.
"I hauled my sewing machine out of storage and made masks out of the only fabric I had on hand, which was valentine Hello Kitty fabric.My husband said they were the only masks that felt comfortable to him. He is a mail carrier and two years later he is still putting on one of his Hello Kitty masks every time he delivers mail to the nursing home on his route. I hope the residents get a kick out of it."
Bandanas tied together with hair ties lol
I was a bandana guy for a LONG time.
This definitely gave me an opportunity to reevaluate my priorities and put them in the correct order. Definitely learned to stand up for myself/my priorities more.
"Be cool if my friends decided to come back and say ""Hey man, Q was dumb, I'm really sorry I put all that over our long friendship we've had"".But nah, they're too deep into it.  They're gone."
"Yes. The pandemic actually opened my eyes to just how depressing America is. I know that people want to come here for better lives, and that we are fortunate to live in a place where we can do that too, BUT I can?t stand looking around at all the businesses- the McDonalds, the mall, even the small locally owned coffee shop. Life before COVID was just consume, consume, consume. Go to the mall, go to the store, go out to eat, buy this, buy that. That?s all we do here. We spend money. We spend our entire days looking for things to do that cost money. The pandemic has taught me to appreciate nature more and to free myself from extraneous spending."
"Mine too, for their own stupid sake. They both got Omicron and recovered, thankfully. I shudder to think what would happen if Delta got them. I still worry about my pregnant unvaxxed sister but I can?t do anything about it."
"My parents are old too, and one has health issues, so the have been my top worry too.  Hang in there!"
Same.
One good thing is that people have begun to question and reject the grind.
"Ugh this is so depressing yet true.I felt angry when I saw that the House and Senate approved this money for the Ukrainian foreign aid. Three weeks. It was with such a quickness!Meanwhile? we had to grovel for weeks and weeks for aid from the government during a pandemic. Don?t get me wrong, I?m pro Ukraine, but holy shit. Our elected officials don?t care about us as people. We?re just pawns I guess."
"You need therapy, friend. Things aren?t nearly as bad."
"A hermit here. I don't worry about getting sick for my own health. I worry about having to close my business for two weeks and putting 10 other people on two weeks unpaid vacation. Still haven't caught it. And yeah, any asshole who hasn't gotten a shot, they're nuts and I don't need them in my life. I'm grateful they're so happy to advertise their choice."
"This, right here. I'm vaccinated, boosted, and I had it. I can't make the tons of people that refuse vaccination get vaccinated. I can't force people to wear a mask. I do what I can and I worry about myself. It's taken a lot of anger and anxiety off."
"on behalf of the unvaccinated, I promise you they don't give a single fuck if you welcome them in your life lol"
"that sounds awful, are you proud of living like a prisoner?"
"We need a new word that is like jaded but, more."
"Kind of like how they?re saying ?see, it?s no worse than flu!? Yeah NOW, after all those people died with Alpha or Delta and millions of vaccines were given and everyone else got the milder variant. You were not right all along and you are DAMN LUCKY you didn?t die when you took horse meds for your COVID. And you don?t know what effects COVID can have later on so?good luck I guess.Talking specifically to my parents now, here. ??"
Agreed.
Good on you for taking care of the vulnerable. Wish society would learn how to do that better.
"I remember hearing about it after Christmas and thinking ?ehhh, this doesnt sound great?? and then two months later word started trickling in more."
"I'm doing a report on the early days of the pandemic and these links are definitely gonna come in handy. Thanks, friend!"
"There is plentiful evidence that it does. And many other cardiovascular issues, including strokes and kidney damage. And things like autoimmune diabetes. Pick an organ, Covid can probably ruin it in the unlucky. And since it's going to keep mutating, everyone is going to get many chances to get unlucky."
Someone yelled at you for being vaccinated? I?m vaccinated and haven?t been yelled at. I see a lot of people yelling at unvaccinated though
"Might be informative for immunocompromised but sounds like watching paint dry for healthy, especially vaccinated, people"
"especially the beyond idiotic 24 hour before flight one, which is almost impossible to get in many countries."
"Agreed, particularly given that many other countries (at least in Europe) have dropped testing requirements. Seems kind of dumb to not have any requirements to visit another country, but then have to scramble to get a test right before my flight home even though I'm vaccinated."
Right? This seems like the most logical thing to drop as it's far more time-intensive and a true exercise in hygiene theater. At least wearing a mask has an actual chance at doing something. The other is just a profit generator for some private lab. Oh wait....
Agreed. I just did this and they didn't even check it. They announced they would randomly select passengers to check. We were in a group of 20 and no one was selected. Seems like its not really a requirement as it is based on that anyway...
It?s ridiculous that this is still a thing. Canada is even dropping it on Friday. Crickets from the US.
"Seriously.  I'm on vacation in Rome, where they have zero testing requirements (they never even asked to see our locator forms). We came here, and are returning to, London -  with zero testing requirements. The only place I have to test is to return to my own country. It's a few weeks away, so we're hoping it'll end before our trip.And we're anxiously watching the news. With our luck the requirement will end days after we return. But one test is better than the 4 we would have had to purchase."
"Would love this so much, traveled last year with my 2 year old and testing him was straight up traumatic. At least drop the requirement for little kids, or keep it for just unvaccinated adults or something!"
waiting for this to drop! I don't want to test positive and be stuck
por que no los dos
"I think I?m masking on flights from here on out to be honest. I?ve still got like 40 N95s left in my box, and I used to get sick to some degree every other time I flew. I had one particularly bad trip years back where I spent almost my whole stay in CA sick with the flu. If I?m taking time off and paying for the trip, and I?ve already got the masks anyway, why not safeguard my investment?"
"Well with your bad knee, Ed, you shouldn't throw anybody."
"I think most places are moving to one-way masking. I think masking mandates should be a dimmer switch, not some permanent on/off switch. A good N95 mask in an airplane is certainly sufficient. Especially once airborne. The problem is that if we get another massive surge in cases, it would be too difficult to get people to re-mask again. Which is very unfortunate because it?s that very phenomenon that makes it difficult to have policies that reduce public safety mandates."
As long as it?s optional.
"May I ask why?  My aim is not to be confrontational, judgemental, or rude.  Serious question here.  I thought the purpose of the mask was to protect others from the mask wearer's germs; not the other way around.  Or do I have that wrong?  Assuming i do not have it wrong, what is the point of being the (potentially) sole person wearing a mask in a crowded situation?"
It's a great way to cover a cold sore
"Just like driving, can't let your guard down."
"Also, being stuck in Hawaii, Mexico, or other place for an unexpected 10 extra days can make for an expensive vacation."
"> Are you about to get back on the plane and infect everyone?A lot of people seem to have no issue with doing this, unfortunately."
"Covid is already rampant wherever you are and wherever you?re going. Air on planes is continuously filtered and refreshed, much more so than air in the local grocery store. Mask mandates on planes do nothing but make an already stressful situation even worse. Wear them if you want, but don?t force masks on anyone else."
What about the asshole sitting next to you coughing and sneezing into your airspace and you can?t move away?  I personally know people who do that and I stay far away from them even outside on a windy day.
Especially planes.. hmm well planes are better than other indoor locations as they have hepa filters and they recycle the air 30 to 50 times more than an office space.
Not even. If it keeps me from getting the flu or a cold then hell yeah. Worth it. Even if it's just once a year benefitting me
"so wear it, nobody has a problem with that. but were at the point now where it should no longer be mandatory"
I might also wear a mask in certain situations. Still I think masking should be a personal choice when health care impact from the virus is under control.
"Please go right ahead.  Please allow those of us who are less risk-averse (I?m vaxxed/boosted) to make our own choices, as well.There are also situations where I may wish to wear a mask."
"Unless they made a new announcement, the CDC still has the mask mandates for public transit modes (including planes) set to expire 4/18."
"It?s almost all political now.  Which is the new ?following the science?, sadly."
"There's ""the science,"" then there's ""what do we do with the science?""  For example, we know that COVID transmits through the air and is a respiratory disease.  That's science.  How to best deal with that on a mass basis isn't quite ""science.""  Could we put every person into a bubble in their homes and lock them down for a full year without any human interaction?  And would that be ""science?""  I mean, that would solve it but is that the way we should do it?"
The risk of infection is lower on planes than many other places we frequent on a daily basis like malls and grocery stores.
"I mean, the science says getting sick is bad, so leave your house as infrequently as possible, and wear a mask when you do for the rest of your life.Obviously, that is not a reasonable or sustainable ask for the vast majority of people."
"Science is ""how does this work""?Policy/politics is ""what do we do with this information?""Follow the science is ""let's align our policy with scientific recommendations"".Ultimately what we do depends heavily on tradeoffs. We are balancing many things, only one of which is the scientific area of disease transmission vectors and rate."
its been this way from week 1 man.  people have been sick of it before we even got vaccines.  crazy times.
Governments just gave up on getting more than 90% of the population vaccinated. Misinformation is rampant and you won't be able to convince the people scared of needles to get the jab anymore.
"The plan for mitigation tactics like social distancing and masks has always been the same regardless of the respiratory virus in question. it's just that people became more aware of these mitigation tactics as they were being enforced instead of suggested. That being said, we use these mitigation tactics when know infection rates are at certain threshold. They've been below that threshold for a while now. That doesn't mean it won't spike again (which it will do again with or without lifting mandates). The plan is always reactionary to reducing the current wave's impact after it arrives. Another wave is on the way, but it seems to be getting people that aren't vaccinated and/or didn't get this last wave, so it remains to be seen if/when mitigation tactics will be mandatory again."
Time to go back to normal. No one is stopping you from wearing a mask. But science supports airplane ventilation to already make them a very low risk place to be maskless.
"Meh. There are a few flight attendants that love the new power. Not a huge amount, but as a frequent flyer there are a few that relish the power."
"Vaccine passports aren't really a great indicator of anything at this point.  I got my booster last Nov, meaning it's basically worthless now.  All the music/sporting venues around me stopped requiring proof of vaccine in the last couple of weeks.  With weaker and weaker variants, I'm honestly unlikely to even get another booster at this point.  Seems kind of pointless as a young, healthy person.  I plan on continuing to mask on planes though... I used to get sick every time I fly and that hasn't happened in the last 2 years, which is pretty nice."
"We should have been doing this for the past year, with or without masks. Biden admin should have waited until like 4 weeks before Thanksgiving 2021 and announced that anyone flying, taking a train, or taking a bus after November 20th is required to have at least one dose. We could have scooped up a few million people just like that."
"Vaccine mandates for entry/ticketing accomplish nothing. Unless you're *recently* boosted, you have negligible to zero protection against being infected (and thus being contagious)."
At least everything doesn't give you acne
Except for that guy a road over from me. He died from COVID Sunday. But that?s too inconvenient for your activities
"you need to read some literature, my friend. I don't have the energy to argue with you about how the immune system works, go through the data about the outrageous efficacy of personal protection granted by the N95. I'm also not 100% sure you're not trolling, this comment is so off-base."
"I don?t mind you wearing a mask at all. Just when the mandates are dropped, don?t blame people for taking a choice and not wearing masks. FFP2 and similar masks should continue to be advised for those that wants to avoid Covid - I?m currently also wearing one if I have something important coming up."
">There is zero downside to mandating masks on planes FOREVER.I'm all for keeping the mandate because I believe the benefit outweighs the cost, but let's not pretend like there is no cost. Masks are uncomfortable. They make communicating difficult, they make eating and drinking difficult, and though not to a level to cause health concerns, they make breathing difficult. We don't need to lie about this reality to decide they're still worth wearing."
"Getting sick ones in a while won't automatically kill you, you know ? If you want to wear a mask forever, it is your personal choice. Please don't try to force anyone who has and wants to keep an functioning immune system to wear one just because you are scared of getting sick at all."
Guess you work for spirit ? Would explain why your so determined to make flying as miserable as possible
I think the lead in your water is getting to you
This is silly. On a plane you can eat and drink (obviously without a mask) and who knows what people do in the bathrooms. Many hang their noses out and the flight attendants can only do rounds so often to correct. A test beforehand to make sure passengers are well makes MUCH more sense.
"I think you have it backwards - once the political stigma of not treating masks as if they're magical has worn off, I think people will see they were over-used. (And just for context, I will probably be continuing to wear a mask on a plane indefinitely, ESPECIALLY if I hear so much as a sniffle from someone within a few rows)."
Like Hong Kong? China?
Really adding some great stuff to the discourse with this.
The biggest action that could be taken is vaccination which I?m guessing most of these 700 per day didn?t do.
What action do you propose?
Is the excess death in the US still above normal levels?I think that's the only question to be answered at this point.
So you have to grow your own broccoli? Or is that something you can find at the store?
"How about microgreens of broccoli, would that be a similar concentration?"
broccoli's good.
"Well, maybe try preparing it a different way.  Sometimes our caregivers prepare foods in ways which they enjoy (or tolerate) but really ruin it for others.  If it's been a while, keep in mind as you age your taste preferences will shift.   Lesser known benefit, when you endorse and support broccoli you can become a member of Big Broccoli Conglomerates (BBC) and use that in your professional and social profiles."
Should try ?crack broccoli? aka broccoli roasted with olive oil and a bit of sugar lol
Sulforaphane is also present in Moringa powder. I add a bunch to a smoothie and it?s super easy to get down.
"Broccoli FTW!There's an even higher concentration of sulfarophane in the peppery delight known as broccoli sprouts.Sulfarophane may also slow certain cancers. I'm not current on the science there, but it's good stuff."
"Like most things kids don?t like, it?s probably because the older generation served veggies soggy/from a can. Broccoli can be incredibly inexpensive if you buy the fresh heads, and you just toss it with olive oil and seasoning (harissa is my favorite) and put in the oven for 20 minutes at 400. It also lasts a while in the fridge (it became a staple of fresh produce in our house when we only wanted to shop once every 2 weeks during Covid)."
<3 you too
> UNLESS you chop your broccoli*[Dana Carvey has entered the chat]*
Or just eat it raw. Dip it in veggie dip or ranch. Broccoli is wonderful raw.
"So frozen broccoli, already being chopped, wouldn't have this enzyme? That's a pity, I usually buy it frozen and in small pieces. Good for throwing into things I have to cook quickly."
You can also just add mustard powder and that activates creation of sulforaphane in broccoli that hasn?t been ?chopped and held? or frozen. https://nutritionfacts.org/video/second-strategy-to-cooking-broccoli/
I think you can also use mustard power to activate it. At least that?s what Dr Greger says.
Some stores sell pre-chopped broccoli florets.
"Also: ""I always knew broccoli was full of microchips!"""
sometimes the body just knows
This is the real reason mice will take over as the dominant species We are committing atrocities against them but learning how to give them excellent health and make them smarter while we do it
"I plan on telling anti-vax morons that the broccoli study was paid for by Pfizer so they won?t trust it, it?ll leave all the broccoli for us and they can stick to drinking their own piss, or whatever they do."
OR?this is as win-win as it gets.
"Vaccines for children came out after covid apathy built up more, community immunity had built up more, and children are at much lower risk for severe outcomes from covid than their parents (especially if they were already infected before vaccines were available). Its to be expected that children vaccination rates are much lower. People have been predicting this since before 5-11 year olds could get vaccines (You can find some examples in the reddit thread posted by u/maxkozlov 5 months ago with the article ""What COVID vaccines for young kids could mean for the pandemic""). Maybe its a bit surprising that its only 30% in LA of all places. But its certainly within expectations."
"Children are at astronomically low risk, and fda approved vaccines for young children had something along the lines of 11% efficacy with delta I believe, presumably lower with omicron. All this is off the top of my head and relatively old, but the data is available nonetheless."
"Anecdotally, parents are weary of a ?new vaccine? without real world data for their kids. Paired with the ?low risk? of COVID in kids. The side effects of the vaccine also sucked for adults and I think that?s scared off parents. Many are waiting. I?m not saying I agree (as long as there is ample safety data I wil get my kid vaccinated? of course I?ll have the privilege of waiting by default since I?m still pregnant)"
Because they are afraid of something that they can?t describe.
"This is incredibly sad. As Dr. Feigl-Ding and Dr. Topol have predicted, we are about to see an unnecessary wave of BA2 infections in schools. One can only hope that children will not develop long COVID at the same rate as adults."
"The vaccine disinformation already convinced a person to refuse the rabies vaccine after they were bitten by a wild animal.  They became the first rabies death in decades.  And recently a member of Congress stated, ""I don't see the CDC recommending a second polio shot"".  FYI, the CDC recommends a series of 4 polio vaccine shots."
"I'm already seeing it in my community. I have a few pregnant friends that are starting to question even the childhood vaccines. Candace Owens is doing a big podcast right now putting a lot of mistrust into the vitamin K shot and supposedly she will be working through all the childhood vaccines. She's doing it ""to help parents ask questions and feel informed."" Which is fine, people should ask questions. People should feel informed, but I get scared at the amount of people who will just take Candace Owens word at face value. Or parents who end up with doctors that dismiss their concerns or berate them. It will only cause people to dig their heels in more. I'm nervous for the next few generations."
"When we got our kid's normal vaccines years ago our doctor was visibly relieved that she didn't have to have a lengthy conversation to convince us to do it. The anti-vaxx idiocy has been rampant for decades, and even people who think they're not susceptible to it have heard it so often that they're now hesitant to get their kids involved. It's a tragedy.Schools should make the vaccine mandatory for attendance, just like the MMR shots. If there's one thing this pandemic has taught me, it's that people can't be trusted to make the right decision when it comes to community health."
"We just got covid and while we all were vaccinated our 3.5 year old obviously wasn't and the covid was harshest for her.I'm upset that the restrictions were lifted before vaccines are available to everyone.Also if you managed to not get covid yet and are wearing surgical masks. Stop, it's a waste of time. Now that people don't wear masks they don't protect anymore, you need to use N95 or equivalent.I was wearing surgical mask and still got infected while waiting in line in a pharmacy. Fuck those people and management."
Oh but it will. Ugh.
"This is a direct result of the overpromises made about the vaccine. The powers that be were unable or unwilling to honestly and accurately discuss the vaccine and as a result have lost public trust on the subject. ""If you take the vaccine, you won't get infected.""""How about making sure that you?re vaccinated, so you do not spread the disease to anyone else."""
Governments and corporations became too untrustworthy.
"As a father in Canada, the hesitation is largely due to the fact that the efficacy of the current vaccines doesn't seem to be that great in young children:https://www.nytimes.com/2022/02/28/health/pfizer-vaccine-kids.htmlOn top of that, other diseases appear to be much worse in children, at least in Canada.

I don't think the vaccine helps them, but I'm open to debating this."

I will vaccinate my children when there is science showing that kids get a measurable health benefit from vaccination after infection.
Same reason everyone should get the shot. Reduce the risk of long Covid and potentially saving yourself a couple thousand bucks on a trip to the ER.
"To ensure they are best equipped to fight the virus when they encounter it by training their immune system to deal with it.No different than adults.Lower risk in youth, yes, but not non-zero... Closer to zero with vaccination.I can't fathom why a responsible parent would want anything but the lowest risk possible for their child.  Protection of one's child is a parent's most urgent responsibility."
lol this can't be a serious question
And yet so damn wrong. Kids deserve better than risking long COVID and other not-yet-known health issues from contracting COVID-19.
"That blows. Maybe you really want to go visit a relative in another state or even a friend that now lives in San Francisco, where those 12+ can provide vax consent.I hope your folks at least let you wear N95 masks."
"I'm so sorry you're stuck in that situation. I hope your parents come around, or you find a way to get the vaccine."
What measures remain in schools ?
very funny! very creative!
"Nobody cares about the amount of infections. As long as ICUs aren?t full and health care isn?t in danger there?s no legitimate reason for restrictions. Everyone could get the vaccine, so it?s the only right call to scrap the restrictions now"
"So scrapping restrictions means the peak will come faster. Look at the US, only 2% positivity rate with almost one million tests per day taken."
"With all the technology that we have today, it's really too bad that intranasal vaccines (in general) weren't already further along."
No kid uses Facebook. Old folks on the other hand...
It was made exponentially worse.
"The last paragraph of the article addresses this point:""That?s why it?s dangerous to allow the children?s mental health conversation to get stuck in the toxic loop of pandemic politics. The acute traumas of the covid era will end, and with them some of American families? situational distress. But the children?s mental health crisis won?t. If we don?t open our minds to its totality, then all the new and ramped-up attention from the past two painful years will end up little more than ?mealy mouthed statements ? like the ?thoughts and prayers? after a school shooting,? as Peter Jensen put it. That is to say: just talk."""
"The early 2010s is when social media ratcheted up its effect on kids, and anxiety, depression & self-harm increased at the same time among teens.  Psychologist Jonathan Haidt has great talks on this on youtube: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pFl5r2h9pm0"
"> Gender identity issuesAre you saying that the freedom (and responsibility?) to choose one's gender is on average causing more stress and mental health issues than it is solving?Edit: downvotes, but no replies. The OP does seem to be saying ""gender identity issues"" are a new thing which is linked to mental illness. I found that surprising so I asked for clarification."
This is heartbreaking. I honestly feel that social media teaches people and now children that their value comes from what others think of them. If they somehow don't fit society's expectations then they are somehow not good enough.. it can't be good for anyone to second guess their value.
"My kid has dyslexia and autism, her issues started way before she was allowed a phone/computer and she is still not allowed to use social media. There are more and more kids presenting with problems at very young ages, talking 4, 5 and 6. Some of it is related to the pandemic, I think there is a deeper problem here than just phones and social media. A few things - since the 2007 recessions a lot of funding (at least in the UK) has been removed from social services and local councils that offered services for parents and young pre-school age children. Social services no longer have the budget for early intervention, they only the resources for the worst cases. By which time it can be too late for the child and in most cases are having to be removed from the family causing further issues. These in the past could have been prevented or lessened with earlier interventions in the past.Parents do not let their children outside as much as they used to. These days its quite common for children up to the age of secondary school never being allowed out of their houses on their own. Parents are too fearful of abductions and accidents. This stifles any introduction to independence and keeps the children in only safe secure zones at home where they have everything and there is no actual conflict or real world problems. Schools are more attuned to children with mental and behavioral issues. Kids would be labeled as stupid and put on remedial studies or just shipped off to special schools. These days these kids are identified and targeted with specialist help from schools, with them trying in the upmost to keep them in mainstream schools. So naturally everyone becomes more aware that there ar eissue sinstead of trying to bury it.The flipside of schools targeting children with special needs and keeping them in mainstream schools is that budgets for schools have not increased in line with these extra resources needed, so schools end up having to do more with less which can be too much for the school and teachers, where they can't deal with the issues properly. Obviously covid is a factor, most teacher and and teaching assistants have seen an uptick of issues since the lockdowns, especially in early years where children missed out on the first year to 18 months of school education, this is mainly anecdotal though and studies are still ongoing. Of course phones and social media will also have an impact, not just directly (although some studies have shown that screen time isn't that bad), but indirectly when parents themselves are consumed with their screens they ignore the child and the child develops other means to gain attention and think that its normal.The main take is that these issues are presenting earlier than when children start using social media, which of course can exacerbate issues when children start reaching their teens."
"The trends in child mental health precede social media, cell phones and even the internet. From the article:""The most worrisome and dramatic effects were occurring among the many, many children ? 1 in 5 is the proportion that has commonly been cited for the past two decades ? who already had diagnosable mental disorders. This is not surprising. Mental health experts know that conditions like severe depression don?t pop up out of nowhere. They may seem to ? particularly to parents when they?re first becoming aware of the signs in their kids ? but there are pretty much always antecedents. At Children?s National, it can take days, and careful teamwork by experts and their trainees, to find and understand them. But at the recent morning?s rounds, the antecedents were starkly on display: histories of depression, anxiety, trauma, self-harm.""My wife is an aid in a small country school, and she says the rate they see this year is closer to 1 in 3. The roots of the problem go much deeper than what kids do on their computing devices."
"Twitch/livestreams has its own issues, parasocial relationships, and trying to stand out by giving big donos or trolling to get big streamers attention.Thats why i only stick to smaller streamers. The communities there are more chill and feel more connected since you see familiar names everytime.Try going to Tyler1 or Mizkif stream and its a chat shitstorm."
"You?re talking about college age kids in honors classes. I think this is more aimed to grade school kids. The 8 year old who spends 6 hours a day on Facebook/Instagram/tiktok kind of deal. Those kids are fucked. I?ve met some stupid little kids and I know they?re stupid because the parents let them be on their phones all day. It?s brain rot. When 70% of the information you take in on a daily basis is big loud, targeted media how are you supposed to develop any kind of critical thinking or communication skills?"
"It really is heartbreaking.  They?re not just growing up like that from their own brains, but from seeing the parents value their own screen over time with their child.  So many kids come home to be with a parent constantly on their phone while they need attention.  That?s the new role model, zoning out on TikTok.Worst part?  I?m guilty of it, too.  I?m not as bad as I?ve seen in some of the homes I?ve been in with Early Intervention, but I still catch myself all the time.  At least TV needed to be watched WITH the person, and you could talk about it later or just share the experience"
"My dopamine is screwed and I graduated college in 2009, so I was saved from most of this crap. I can't imagine what its like for them."
"?Personally, I think allowing children unlimited, unsupervised access to technology and the internet is harmful for the developing brain.?I work as a speech pathologist with disabled kids, mostly very severe cases.  I could not agree with this more, particularly for children demonstrating delayed language or social skills.  It?s not noticeable in all kids, but the ones that are delayed are often severely hindered by the constant availability of tech.  I truly wonder what the human interaction is going to be like in 50 years.  If climate change, pandemic, or nuclear war hasn?t gotten us.What a weird time to be alive"
Your post is really difficult to read for someone with ADHD. Consider using multiple paragraphs next time. Meant sincerely!
It?s incredibly hard to control  - especially with the school computers they get that we can?t add any parental controls to.  We?ve tried just about everything we can think of and they still figure out a way to get content.
"Champion comment here. We need to do something. A lot of people feel this way although you said it almost perfectly. There is also science behind it. But as a society we just forget and don?t see it as an immediate concern. The poor kids (us adults too) are suffering from this hyper-digital-media culture and it?s just frying their young brains right out. Not to mention the terrible good-to-bad role model ratio. Like you said, negativity in the limelight."
"I'm sorry, but this comment is so vacuous as to be ridiculous. As the article stated, the problem is not studied enough to have hard numbers, but the roots of most kids mental illnesses stem from poverty, home stress, pre-natal drug use, and broken families, not from Instagram pics. In fact, technology during the pandemic has allowed my kids to stay connected to their peers in ways that would otherwise be impossible. For many kids, it's been a lifeline.People always reach for easy excuses to problems like this because the real roots of our mental health crisis are difficult and expensive to fix. Technology may contribute around the edges of the problem in both good and bad ways, but tossing out the kids' cell phones won't fix a thing."
"I honestly think that extreme inequality also has an impact. Growing up knowing that you?ll probably have to be in the top 25% of earners to be able to afford to do things like buy a house, have a car, save for retirement, etc, means that there?s a lot of pressure on kids to be the best. If you doing super well, there?s intense pressure not to slip and throw everything away. If you aren?t, that?s a catalyst for depression."
Climate change ?
100%. My toddler was in speech therapy starting shortly before age 2 during the pandemic - it was ALL over zoom for an entire year. In what universe do people actually think video conference speech therapy is an appropriate substitute for in person for a toddler?
"As a 16 year old who was doing fine before this happened and then had a sharp decline, thank you! I?ve been gaslighted so many times here because I dare say restrictions made life miserable. I was literally told last year ?at least you?re not living during a war?This comes from a group that claims to care about mental health, and it?s annoying.And I supported all Covid restrictions and vaccinations too."
It?s funny how these people are saying kids staring at their screens is causing them mental health problems when that?s all they can do during online school and staying homeThese are the same people who criticized parents for wanting their kid to play in the park
There is going to be a lot of gaslighting/revisionist history regarding the fact that we destroyed 2-3 years of people?s  young lives.
"I agree with this so much. It?s the same thing with anyone who admits to not liking wearing a mask and wanting to stop. The ?it?s just a piece of cloth? crowd come crawling out of the woodwork to hurl accusations of being anti-mask and to call people whiny babies because they want to be able to see people?s faces when they talk to them. My favorite is when they compare it to wearing pants, as though a huge portion of human communication isn?t done with facial expressions and it?s totally the same thing as covering your fuckin junk. I wore a mask diligently all through the pandemic and I?m enjoying no longer having to do it.Lol at the downvotes on this. Proving my point exactly. Here let me apologize: omg I love wearing a mask! It feels great and is totally not uncomfortable at all and I?m so happy to do it for 10 hours everyday!"
Irony

If only there were some way to prevent breathing in these deadly airborne pathogens in the first place?alas.
Rona would probably just find a different life-long negative outcome for you. Ugh.
Switching from type 2 to type 1 would be pretty devistating.
"That may be a contributing factor. My brother went to get a physical for the first time in years after catching Covid. Thankfully, nothing bad was found."
"I?ve been reading about the increase in type 1 diagnosis after Covid. The virus creates an autoimmune response that kills the beta cells in the pancreas, thus no insulin production and type 1 diabetes.However, this article talks about increase in Type 2 after corona. Maybe it?s both."
It's partisan drama... That's all.
Having deja vu here.
!remindme 6 monthsJust so we can have a reunion and console each other. :(
On top of that they?re vaccinated with Sinovac which has proven ineffective to BA.2 in comparison to the mRNA vaccines
"Every country has to ""pay their dues"" in cases when it comes to Omicron."
"Come on, hundreds of thousands of Chinese civilians may die soon, not something I'd cheer."
What?
"Thanks, I've really enjoyed that you've been doing this. Good bot!"
Great bot!
"I never used to. My reasoning was that I never got the flu, so why would I get the vax? I get the flu shot now."
I know a surprising number of people who are still super sanctimonious about covid precautions and didn?t get their flu shot in 2020 or 2021. Makes zero sense.
This take is the right take. Well said.
"This is the thing, while the measures may be no big deal to many. The effect of not being able to plan anything even weeks into the future because of changing rules etc is seriously downplayed by alot of people.Feels like the last 2 years were just wasted"
"Hilariously many of the measures we instituted in 2020 that didn't work for COVID (like plexiglass barriers, sanitizer everywhere, cloth masks, etc) would actually work really well for the flu. That's where those measures came from, actually - best practice from previous flu outbreaks. (Flu spreads by droplets, not aerosols like COVID)"
We made one strain of the flu pretty much extinct with masking and handwashing efforts to stop covid.
"I?m confused. You think free flu shots?which are already a thing at many community clinics, BTW?would make people take the flu more seriously?"
"I've never had a cold that made me think ""I should go to the ER."" Heck, not even ""Maybe I should see if my doc has any openings in the next few days."" But the flu? Yeah. Once, and never, ever again do I want to go through that."
Holy shit that's 70% less than people with already three doses. Must be something like 95% less than unvaxxed.
I seriously wonder if Israelis are immune to conspiracy theories since so many batshit crazy conspiracies include antisemitism.  Israel has been like a beacon throughout the whole pandemic.
"There are other variables involved here as well. Time since second booster, lifestyle, etc. Like, if most of the 1 booster group were a bunch of party animals, non mask wearers etc and most of the 2 booster group lived secluded lifestyles and were overly cautious, that would skew the numbers. I know the odds of something like that are low, but those types of things have to be taken into account."
I imagine it will also improve the rates for younger people. However they aren't nearly as at risk of dying as older people are. So I doubt it will get recommended for them.
"This is the huge issue. It seems to all be about when you had the last dose, not how many you've had. Can we really do booster shots every 6 months?"
"There's no downside to me for taking a free and effective booster when I can, so I will do so."
"I?d read that even regular flu shots wane in 6 months or so. Part of the reason it?s annual?that and a different flu variant. I got my second booster yesterday, mostly because I?m going to Vegas in 2 weeks.  I?m thinking this will likely be the last one."
"I feel like this has been my question for the past year or so as well.  I mean if I have to get a Covid plus flu shot every year, I?m fine with it, especially if they can pair them up like I did this season."
"We can also make an omicron specific vaccine that is more attuned to the virus and it's mutations, which would hopefully increase efficacy by a moderate degree. Since it looks like future variants are going to be variants of omicron, it makes sense since the current vaccines are based on OG Wuhan variant from three years ago.I think Moderna announced they are working on one last year"
"I got infected six weeks after I got my booster, and all of the news and studies at the time said a booster helped protect against Delta infection but not Omicron so we just got unlucky.   I'm not in high risk situations, I haven't left my house since my booster and got infected by a vaxxed family member I barely interacted with. So I'm not sure what the protection from infection time frame was for me after my booster but it had to have been measured in weeks not months.  Not immunocompromised by the way, just a hermit.  I see no guidance about a timeline for 3 shots + infection to get a second booster either."
"Why not worth it for the rest of us? They are free and safe. Even if you don't die, you are much more likely to have long covid issues if not vaccine protected."
Part of the problem is that they're still giving the same shot that's based on the original wild type virus. It hasn't been updated despite the fact that the virus has been evolving this whole time
I don't know why they don't just open up boosters every 6 months for people who want them. They could even have us pay. There's no massive shortage of vaccines now so it wouldn't affect anyone who needed it.
People forget about long covid. I'd rather have a booster dose each 6 months than having to deal with that shit.
"It seems to be the time since your last shot, not the amount you?ve had."
"It is, the booster's effect fades though, especially in old/vulnerable people, so they benefit from a second booster after a while."
Yes but the 4th booster temporarily increases antibody levels so you might not become infected at all. You can?t die from COVID if you don?t become infected.
"In general yes, if you have a healthy immune system. This study focused exclusively on people over 60 years."
"UKHSA data showed 2 doses as reducing severe disease in breakthroughs about 3-fold, with very little protection against infection.  A third dose brought that to 5-fold, with up to a 4-fold protection against infection.  So that's a combined 20-fold protection from the booster dose versus only 3-fold from the second dose.But the protection against infection wanes with time (indeed the comparison isn't really very good above, since it's comparing recent boosters versus old second doses).  It wanes down to under a 2-fold protection after a few months, and beyond that we don't really know.But since a lot of older people got their third doses a long time ago (in August or even before, for Israel), that's not ideal with cases still being high in many places.  Just bringing the 2-fold back up to a 4-fold is itself a 50% reduction in death.  But it looks like the fourth dose does even more than that.We're getting to really high levels of protection here.  But by comparison, 3 doses was over 99% effective at preventing Delta hospitalizations, with waning being almost too slow to measure.  The level of protection vs Omicron still isn't near that level - and presumably won't be until we have omicron-targeting vaccines."
"> Senior citizens who received a second booster of the Pfizer?BioNTech COVID-19 vaccination had a 78% lower mortality rate from the disease than those who got one only, a study from Israel showed on Sunday.If you are frail and elderly, get another booster.If you are young and healthy, chill out for now.After the 2+1 series, your experience with Covid is most likely going to be similar to any other cold caused by a coronavirus.  Someone who is too frail to survive a cold should get an extra booster."
"Sample size was half a million,  total deaths were 300, 200 from 3 shots and 100ish from 2 boosters. That's a negligible death rate between the two populations anyway[Edit] the people downvoting are ridiculous. Clearly fewer than 1 in 1000 that got the disease died from it in the 60-100 age group.  The difference between the mortality of 2 boosters versus 1 is statistically insignificant.  130 fewer deaths out of 100,000+ population is within error, it is less than .1%58% got 2 boosters, so we will round up to 300000, 92 diedMortality is 92300000 = .00031or .031%230  200,000 = .00115 or .11%Oh yeah,  if we care only about the difference in percentages this looks significant,  but the pure fact that pretty much any confidence level is going to have a margin of errror greater than .1%, this is all insignificantThe conclusion is that a single booster still works"
that was a long time ago
How?
Great point. I think this plays a large factor.
I would guess it would be the other way around - those with health issues that bring covid risk - and those with weaker immune system - will be more likely to rush for a 4th shot than those who feel healthy. For example if you have diabetes you want all the shots you can get.
"I think you are over thinking this. 1. It doesn't make a huge difference anyway. 2. You can get it now then get another later, the shot is pretty safe. 3. Getting Rona later is preferable because better treatments are coming out all the time. Plus the virus is more likely to mutate into a less lethal variant."
Because you're gonna get another booster later. There's no point in not getting one.
"Because it doesn't suddenly drop to zero. And you can get infected even when cases are low in your country, especually with how infectious Omicron is."
"Unfortunately Omicron-specific boosters have shown little improvement over the original shots and most likely won?t be coming to market, at least from Moderna and Pfizer. I think what they?re looking at next are combined boosters with both the original and the Omicron-specific? I could remember that incorrectly."
I know multiple people who have already gotten the fourth shot
"Second paragraph of the article > The country?s largest healthcare provider, Clalit Health Services, said the 40-day study included more than half a million people aged 60 to 100."
That's exactly what was being said about the first booster back in about September - October.
What do you mean?
You can go get another booster anywhere they don?t really care
All those downvotes. How dare he protect others and himself
"Me too. I am not old nor vulnerable, but I would like to take it given the opportunity. I would hate to be sick for two weeks because my university seems to not give a shit about students who test positive."
"See the bottom paragraph of [this post](https://yourlocalepidemiologist.substack.com/p/another-mrna-booster-or-not?s=r):      >I know J&J people are feeling left behind. Data continues to show that a J&J + 1 booster is working as well as the mRNA three dose series. We don?t know why, but there are many hypotheses. For example, the adenovirus biotechnology may lead to greater durability and ?affinity maturation??more sophisticated antibodies over time. Or, this may be a biproduct of mixing vaccine biotechnologies. In short, you do not need a third dose right now. We?re all keeping an eye on the literature."
Thank you.
"Honest question (sorry if it comes across as insensitive), are you old or debilitated? Is taking care of yourself while sick for 1-2 days really that difficult for you where you need someone to take care of you? Is a shot once every YEAR really so frequent for you where it?ll significantly reduce your quality of life?I?d understand if it was once every 3-4 months. But every YEAR is more than reasonable. I get sick after every shot for 48 hours but I gobble up some soup and watch netflix. I never have someone taking care of me."
"Damn, then it's gonna really suck when COVID takes you out of commission for a week instead. And you don't even get to choose which week. Bummer!"
I think it just restores the antibody levels back to what it was after the 3rd shot. The original info about a 4th shot not being any better was referencing a negligible antibody increase over the 3rd shot when comparing similar time after dose.
They did / do but protection dwindles over time.Not sure where it might be any different from a flu vaccine that tons of people get every year
"This study was frail elderly, who we know benefit from boosters for all kinds of things that aren?t an issue for younger people.So far there are no indications that healthy younger people need more Covid boosters."
Could you elaborate?
Completely unnecessary
"Two- yearly shot, seems like. ??"
"Second booster = fourth shot,"
"I'm not used to reading studies, but does this show that there's virtually no increased risk from vaccination? I'm seeing it has the same rate per million as the pre-covid rate."
I think he finds the increased viral load scientifically interesting because it?s already been established that BA.2 is more transmissible than BA.1. So more viral load in the upper respiratory tract that ALSO better infects people. Ooof.
"It's still a good surrogate if you compare like-with-like and early in the infection, not during the recovery phase. No one is going to do 1000s, much less 100,000s, of in vitro infection experiments.Anyway, 2x is not a big difference. Compared to the \~1000x difference between Delta and original strain."
"Not really, it seems to track with the rate of viral replication pretty well. The caveat is that people will often have a low (but nonzero) amount of RNA weeks after infection, but while the RNA is detectable it's also a much smaller amount than when they're actively infectious.Overall, it is a pretty good proxy for amount of infectious virus I'm the upper airway."
"It seems that it will come down to whether or not (or how well) BA.1 protects against BA.2; although the research studies done to this point indicate that it protects [exceptionally well](https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-022-00558-w). If a significant proportion of a population was either exposed to, or infected by BA.1, then BA.2 simply doesn't have the same pool of hosts to try and infect. The end result is a muted or non-existent ""sixth wave"". Although I take issue with calling it a wave before any signs of it having that kind of force in literally any jurisdiction a bit of journalistic license to scare people."
...I mean.....he only is as successful as he is due to his family getting rich off of apartheid......
"That's because he's likely a sociopath, as most billionaires have to be to accumulate that much wealth from the mouths of the poor and hungry in the world."
"One would presume the test is the ""supposed"" evidence"
"He might have worded it that way so you could interpret it like that if you wanted to, but in full context, it seems like he's saying Omicron has changed so much from the original COVID that it should no longer be called COVID. Also dislike that message... Hong Kong data showed BA.2 with similar mortality rate in elderly to original COVID, and significantly higher morbidity in children than original COVID"
>But we?re past the phase of people listening to the government on this.I strongly disagree there - there is a very large part of the population that wouldn't chose on their own to wear a mask but also don't consider it a big deal and would go along with any mandates or even strong recommendations.
Politicians are just  following the science. Political Science in this case.
99 people exercising good hygiene get instantly turned to infected statistics by the one asshole who is sick and not wearing a mask or exercising good hygiene
Wearing a mask is better than sanitizer. Sorry to break it to you
"Not just will, but perhaps legality of the means by which mandates were imposed may be expiring."
That?s exactly it. YOLO
People were complying in NYC. People still wear masks here without a mandate.
You forgot they declared that the monoclonal treatment was declared ineffective against omicron. Non mrna vaccines are less effective as well. Anyway the main point that people forgot is the long covid. Seeing people with just mild symptoms for a few days get that shit makes you think 3 times before considering things safe out of belief.
"We shouldn?t need mandates, but our population acts like petulant children. If they understood that this was about health and had an instinct for self preservation today and when they get older, mandates would not even be a thing. Unfortunately, we live in an idiocracy."
Deaths and hospitalizations are down CURRENTLY. It will likely not stay that way. And long COVID and the strain on our health care system are just as concerning as ppl dying.
"Nobody is against that, people are against blanket mask mandates all day everywhere with no ebd in sight."
"Contrary to what many in Reddit believe, pre-covid, universal mask usage in Asia during seasonal respiratory disease cycles (e.g. flu during the winter) was never a thing. People there have always been more open to wearing masks when they are sick, or when they live with someone vulnerable. And of course, mostly, in cities with high levels of air pollution. But that's it. And people in western countries can do that if they want.But continuous, seasonal mask mandates are losing political viability. Smart politicians can see that. Mask mandates were an instrument to bridge us from a time without vaccine or treatments or general understanding of covid until such things were achieved. That bridge has been crossed and, today, the proper tool to fight covid are vaccines."
"That would be nice, but many Americans will definitely not do that because it?s ?tOo hArD tO bReAtHe? ?iT hOrTs mY eAwS?"
">Because this virus is here to stay, anyone 5+ who wants a vaccine has been eligible to get one for monthsI would also add that 1) Paxlovid is much more readily available than it was even a month ago, in NYC you can have it delivered free to your door and 2) N95 masks are available cheaply everywhere, if you want to wear one no one is stopping you.  The political will for ""mandates"" is gone and isn't coming back."
"deprived of normal schooling' because they have to wear a mask is a bit dramatic.Zoom classes are deprivation of normal schooling, but wearing something extra...? erm..."
I'm calling for masking in schools and don't think mandates should be in place for several more years.
"If only there were some way to know which way things are trending *before* hospitalizations and deaths go up. Wouldn't that be helpful? Bah, probably just crazy talk."
*\*laughs in Long Covid\**
That's really short sighted. Long term effects are going to be crippling with that type of policy.
"My vaxxed and boosted friend ""beat"" COVID in a few days, never being hospitalized.A few months later, this healthy man has diabetes.Long COVID is going to fuck us royally with your attitude."
"My state no longer reports ANY of the numbers, and we went from 7,000 cases a week, to 24,000 cases the following week.I found these numbers from a local newspaper article, so I went to check the very latest figures on the state government's own website, and they were off by a factor of 5 times.Our state only has about 600,000 people, and we rely on tourism to survive. Our borders have only been open for a month, mask mandates ended around the same time. The entire COVID management plan is now non-existant.To put this into perspective, a week ago, infections quadrupled, and no-one is wearing masks where they rightfully should (supermarkets are a prime example). In my area, more than 28% of the adult population has the virus now.:-/"
That?s simply bullshit
Don?t underestimate this virus. I can think of hypotheticals where we would have no choice but have restrictions again. Any variant with high immune escape or that affects children badly instead of the elderly would potentially bring restrictions. I get nervous when people say never only because the virus has been relentless and we still know so little about it.I hope you are right and we stay at where we are now and improve slowly.
"I think it?s been established that pandemic protections need to be established at the local level.I don?t agree with the CDC redefining criteria so that almost all the country was green. National mandates don?t work. I blame the CDC for a huge failure in virtually every aspect of the pandemic. So, I don?t remember where the idea that we don?t need masks came from, but it was a political decision - not a public health decision.Now we have an even more contagious variant, that has higher viral loads, and we are in the same situation as Delta and omicron BA.1 in that we had a lull and failed to prepare.Edit: the only three consistent things have been:1. The vaccines have saved our ass.2. We constantly underestimate this very dangerous virus.3. We learn the wrong lessons from each wave.(4. We will be suffering the fallout from poor public health decisions for decades.)"
Yes
Children under 5 have no vaccine.
"I may have to, because of health problems, if I want a few more years instead of months, but you all do you."
upvote for hilarity
It has nothing toDo with NUC.
He ignored it in Ca. At his Fremont assembly plant. See what the Chinese say about his hesitation to close
No need to drum up reactionaries to counter voters that want to tax oligarchs during a pandemic that benefited monopolies.
What about this is political? The reasons China needs COVID zero are practical.
"I don't buy the argument that the policy is necessarily ""out of date and unachievable"". here's a more eloquent article written by the guardian (https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/mar/28/no-covid-approach-bad-press-but-worked)I think a lot of us are seeing lackluster government responses or inability for the US to culturally embrace a good response as 'the standard' because it hurts our egos to think there can be better. This type of thinking plagues all of our issues, from the possibility of universal healthcare, to voting rights, to climate change, pretty much any ""collective"" problem. Like the article i linked says, it was plan A, and it performed spectacularly. That should be a 'win' column. They *still* have time to enact plan B, especially comparing death rates with other nations - think about that, their plan A was so good, as it's failing they still have time to enact plan B. I also think that people here in the US are incredibly nonsensical. If you want to save lives, then save lives. If it's about the economy, then do what is necessary to save the economy. Fortunately, for a pandemic, to do BOTH, you have to go to covid zero - its the SAME solution. That is how you maximize both goals. *Just do it*. The two-faced arguments in this country was unbelievable -- people who wanted to save the economy was arguing to ignore the virus, not realizing that it would have destroyed our GDP. And if we wanted to save people we should do everything... except to spend money on ventilation standards, domestic mask factories, and robust health care systems. We are *compromised* here in the US, and we keep lying to ourselves by lowering the standards rather than aiming higher."
Sure. But thus far their results have been far fewer deaths and two years of China-sized economic growth expansion. Hard to see it any way other than that they came out ahead.
"Wear one, nobody is stopping you. I'm typing this from a crowded bar full of unmasked people, btw."
"Bold conclusion, I hope its accurate."
It's 'Ukraine' and not 'the Ukraine'Consider supporting anti-war efforts in any possible way: [[Help 2 Ukraine](https://help2ukraine.org)] ????[[Merriam-Webster](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/Ukraine)] [[BBC Styleguide](https://www.bbc.co.uk/newsstyleguide/u)]^(Beep boop I?m a bot)
You?re my favorite bot. :)
This is going to hurt a lot of people.
I?m right there with you. Somehow our response keeps getting worse.Edit: it?s not ?somehow.? It?s solely due to politicizing the pandemic for gain instead of prioritizing public health in a way that we could be back close to normal now. I don?t see us recovering from 2020-2022 for decades.
Funny how the Senate sees it that way.
For now I have a feeling that with so much focus on the conflict in Ukraine plus the extra refugees Europe may have a surge as well
to be fair adherence to COVID quarantine and vaccine protocols did contribute to the delay in the release of the 3rd season.
Agreed.  A cardiologist suddenly became considered a COVID expert because he got retweeted by the right people.
It's been a hell of a time with a kid born Jan 2020. Anyone else out there with a toddler who's trying to keep them in a bubble knows. I feel like I've been playing pocket Mercy to a Genji for 700 days.
What are those neurological causes? Like what does that entail for the child?
That?s incredible
"What's even more maddening is not knowing whether or not we've already had it. I think since the pandemic started we've been sick around 10 times. Lots of colds, a couple of fevers, myself included. But the rapids always showed negative. However, it also feels statistically unlikely to have avoided the most infectious disease yet have gotten so many others in that span."
"The thing is, we cant do anything about it anymore. The people who?ve wanted vaccines already have gotten it. The rest of the population won?t bother. We?ve been in a pandemic for 2 years. People are tired. We?re tired. We?re tired of living our life in a bubble. You cant prevent a virus like this. No matter how many vaccines you roll out, no matter how much masking you try to do, the virus will never go away. It?ll forever be apart of our lives. If we keep enforcing masks every time there?s a surge, or keep locking down everything, our economy and workforce will be destroyed for an extremely long time."
Good point. We should vaccinate against TB at the same level we are trying to vaccinate against Covid. It?s a pretty regional sickness I think and a lot harder to catch so might be tough to get all countries on board
I wonder why the difference. Maybe a bunch of the population had previous exposure to Covid or the vaccines so it didn?t spread into too many kids?
"Thank you. For the record, I am not a bot nor do I work for the Khmer Times newspaper in any capacity whatsoever."
"By that definition then those who got the Pfizer vaccine would be getting half the dose for it to be a booster. In reality only those who are getting Moderna as a ?booster? are getting a partial dose. Those who get Pfizer as a ?booster? are getting the same exact full dose they did in the primary shots. So really it just depends on what vaccine the person is getting. Those who meet certain criteria of being immunocompromised would actually get a full dose of Moderna instead of the half dose for their 3rd dose as well. Because it can be so confusion depending on the persons specific situation most places probably feel it is just easier to consider anything past the primary 2 shots as a ?booster?, even if it doesn?t meet the definition you described."
Where are you getting your definition? The medical dictionary I use only says ?second shot? with no mention of dose.
Or is this because the story keeps changing?
"When the clinical trials indicate that it has efficacy in that age group.  So far, they've failed to do so."
Seriously. I?ve got to put my kids into preschool and daycare in September and I am freaking out. Clock is ticking for us. I just want them to be safe.
"This is not the same thing. You got a third dose and a booster, this is a second booster."
"This virus seems to mutate too quickly for targeted, variant specific boosters to be an effective option. By the time your omicron booster is ready, omicron will be old news and we?ll be dealing with a new variant. For what it?s worth, the mRNA shots (Pfizer and Moderna) appear to be fairing pretty well against omicron."
"do happen to have mild headaches? not during your mild case, but after"
Thank you for sharing these articles and wearing your mask. Properly fitted masks are underrated during these uncertain times.
Ok good for you
Glad your dad beat the odds. Hooray for science!
"I got covid in early January 2020. When I inevitably wound up in the hospital for treatment of the clots in my lungs, they took a blood draw, and then again a day later because the first set had clotted in the tubes."
Like that one anti vaxxer guy said
do you know where we can read about this ? published papers ? journals ?
"Oh I hear you. It?s so damn frustrating that the onus for public health is now on us as individuals. A few things you can do yourself:1. Wear a well-fitted respirator mask at all times in indoor public spaces, particularly when cases are increasing or high locally2. Physically distance when you are able3. Increase time spent outdoors and in well ventilated spaces with great air filtration4. Stay home when you feel sick (and rapid test early and often if you think you might have the Rona)"
"Vaccines do limit infections, though. Before omicron, they had a huge impact; now it?s a noticeable impact, but not as huge. But they do still have a massive effect on how severe the disease is, and your body?s ability to fight off the disease (because of the vaccine) limits the effects of lingering side effects and other issues."
"What most people do is rationalize or deny furiously. They ignore the problem or even their own worrying symptoms like any other overwhelming problem that they can't deal with thinking about. I'm seeing it constantly with people I know.That being said, any given mild infection is probably not something to panic over if you're boosted. If you don't have concerning symptoms after a month or two you probably came out fairly unscathed. It probably raised your cardiovascular risk some, but probably on the same level as hanging around secondhand smoke. This is where we could use some better, concrete risk numbers instead of sticking our collective heads in the sand. The kicker though is that with Covid making the rounds every 6 months or less, those odds start looking grim in the long run. Every new variant infection dodged matters, and gives your body time to recover, but it's going to be extremely hard to completely avoid it with how things are going."
"Nope. Probably not good. Maybe your friends need to get vaccinated if they haven?t already, and start regularly wearing N95s in public indoor spaces."
I'm not sure if there are any studies that mention that.
"And after reading what you quoted, I'm still wondering ""greater than what"". Greater than... not having it?"
"To greater clarify, the study with veterans showed an increase mostly in hospitalized patients. Very little increase in risk in non hospitalized."
"Scary stuff, which is why I mask up with an N95. Thanks for pulling that together for folks."
I?m assuming you figured this out already but compared to ?placebo/control group? which in this case is ?not covid?.
This is a good question. I?m not sure why you?re being downvoted.
Numerous young people over in r/covidlonghaulers report high heart rate months/year plus after getting covid.
I think it?s just an ad for not getting COVID.
Than anyone imagined a ?respiratory illness? might(Headlines have to be short. That?s why you gotta read the article.)
"The issue is that problems add together.  Bigger problems don't negate smaller problems; rather, having smaller problems at the same time as bigger problems makes them that much worse.The problem isn't solvable though; there's nothing that can be done about it.  It's just going to be another few tens or (Europe-wide) hundreds of thousands of deaths on top of everything else that's going on.   In the meantime anyone in a war or refugee zone who's able to get a vaccine dose should absolutely get one."
"Their priority should be raising money for Ukraine, instead."
Reporting. Thats the key word. Most will take a home test and never report it.
so really he has no clue
I?ve been wondering this exact thing for a good week now. Seems like we?ve been about to surge much much longer than with OG omicron.
"*""No one knows for sure what will happen next, and some experts are somewhat split in their predictions""**?We need a peak and a trough, and we haven?t reached the trough. We keep creating new peaks.?**""U.S. policymakers should focus less on gaming out the pandemic?s timeline and more on promoting things that are proven to work, such as wearing a high-quality mask, improving indoor ventilation, and encouraging people to get vaccinated?including with boosters, which have so far failed to catch on widely in the U.S.""* AND*""It?s too soon to let up on infection-prevention measures.""*Is what sticks out to me the most."
"Testing has also enormously declined during this time, which may be a factor in the rising positivity rate. If the only people getting tested anymore are those who feel sick, positivity rates will inevitably increase."
Not too concerned. That?s baffling.
How are you feeling? I hope it hasn?t been too bad.
Keep in mind hospitalizations and deaths lag a few weeksWell see in late April if it is or isn't bad right now
How could it possibly go well? I mean even a few reasons would suffice. There?s little to no protections in place.
"The Reddit COVID cycle (depending on where we are, it?s one of these answers) 1. Cases are still low 2. Vaccines and boosters are the way out. To hell with the unvaccinated. 3. Masks clearly don?t work if this many cases are being reported. 4. Relax, it?s mild. Just a cold. 5. Only the unvaccinated are dying. 6. Endemic. 7. Its good that it?s spreading, we want a mild variant to spread for herd immunity. 8. Relax, it peaked. 9. No one could?ve predicted this. Just vaccinate and booster. If your under (use whatever age you want. Each wave it seems to trend older and older) you?re good to go. Keep living your life. 10. We need to learn to live with it."
"100%. I still wouldn?t trust them to have regularly changed HEPA filters, though."
"I hope I am wrong, but I don?t see many buildings and businesses?outside of maybe restaurants?implementing these changes when they can just put the onus on us to mask up."
"A year? Shooooooot. We should have started in Jan/Feb 2020.You know, when we didn?t have masks but could have been focused on improving ventilation.F."
"And, ya know, millions of businesses lease their space and can?t just unilaterally update their ventilation systems."
"And they always talk about their ?brave battle?. Not really though, just a long suffocation while they consume 400k-1mil in treatment."
"The descent into tribal divisiveness in the past 5 years has been absolutely astonishing.  It's not the pandemic and it's not just social media.  Really hope people pull their heads out of their ass sometime in the near future, I'm done with it."
"Not sure if they actually have the free vaccine supply for that now. Funding didn?t get renewed, right?"
"Also will it just be for over 50? Or will the usual assortment of ""high risk"" also be approved so you don't get a healthy 50 year old being eligible over a sick 49.5 year old. Or also just the people who want to reduce the chance that their plans get destroyed by catching Covid even if they probably won't get too sick from it."
Israel data?
Wouldn?t conquest be riding around this time as well?
"Often during war most victims die from starvation and diseases, not from bullets. So yes, you should be worried about diseases."
"Refugees may be living in cramped/improvised settings.  Lack of enough sanitary installations (baths, toilets, washing machines), poor garbage recolection, damaged infrastructure and strained health systems are a risk."
Children being injured directly by the fighting and indirectly by the fighting interfering with the medical system are both equally tragic. Why wouldn?t they be? There?s plenty of examples of war zones where disease took as many lives as bullets.
What? Are you inferring its not a bad thing that people in Ukraine now also have to struggle with multiple harmful diseases and try to live homeless with HIV? This post is most definitely not whats out of touch.
"The article mention improper care for people living with HIV, hepatitis C, diabetes and cancer since the infrastructure has been destroyed.  Also risk for outbreaks of tuberculosis, cholera, pneumonia and covid."
"Thank you. The math in this gave me a headache.Btw, I wanted to get a rough sense of how much BA.2 cases were actually increasing. I took the national case count for a week and the CDC estimate for the proportion of BA.2 cases and multiplied those together. Comparing last week and the week before, it looks like it?s actually increasing by about 30% week over week."
God save me from context-free Covid case number reporting. ??
"Too late, just read the comments here. Clickbait strikes again."
This has been a problem the entire time.. specific wording to make headlines sound as scary as possible. Edit problem is most people never read the article and only see the scary headlines
I?ve noticed this has been the move with BA.2 articles lately. Talk about the **huge** increase??.. *in the portion of cases that are BA.2.*
Thanks that title is very misleading otherwise
"The headline isn't misleading, it's not clickbait, it's fucking wrong. Like you're saying, the case *share* has gone up. The wording they used is completely different. But the kind of people looking for the news this headline suggests are going to eat this up."
"Based upon other countries like the UK, cases don?t start increasing until BA2 hits >50% of cases. So I don?t expect numbers to take off just quite yet.>between February 27- March 5, 14.7% of sequenced cases were the BA.2 Yeah they have awhile to go yet. Educated guess I?d say they have a month to go before BA2 hits 50% of cases. But from then on, who knows. Maybe the first wave of Omicron really did cause enough herd resistance."
"I?ve seen online that?s things are very uneven. Ex:  In the UK, hospitalizations are up 20%?but it was pointed out they weren?t differentiating between ?hospitalized WITH Covid? and ?hospitalized DUE TO Covid.?  Big difference.  And that Spain wasn?t seeing an increase in hospitalizations at all.  A lot less uniformity. Could it be vaccination rate?  That Spain had SO many cases early in the pandemic?maybe more natural immunity and/or those most likely to be hospitalized or die already have?  We may never know."
This headline brought to you by Pfizer CEO.
"BA.2 variant cases are not generally reported separately, and so it's hard to tell if it's a concern.The question is how fast the absolute number of cases of the new variant is rising and whether you can treat it as independent of other COVID cases.  If the total cases in LA are flat, that would mean BA.2 is more than doubling each week, and that's pretty bad, even if it's a small number now.  You have to ask whether that exponential growth will continue."
Is anyone really unsure of that?
"This makes me feel that BA.2 won't cause as big of a surge as BA.1 and BA1.1 did. If you look at the chart history, it **very quickly** overtook Delta."
How do you see the full history of the variants on that page instead of the last three months?
Any idea why? I was looking at this earlier too and it seems like per 100k case rate in the US is roughly the same as UK / Europe. Vax rates are higher in Europe fwiw.So why do they have a bunch of BA2 while we don?t?
"Yes, but with the amount of home testing available now cases aren?t quite as likely to surge. People may still be testing positive, but if they?re vaccinated and have minor symptoms, they?ll likely never report their results."
"It wouldn't really start surging until it becomes the dominant strain.But, cases have generally been dropping or staying flat at a low level -- which is expected as BA.2 takes over.The only worrying sign is the infection rate is trending back towards 1 most places in the US, and some places are just getting back over 1. As long as they stay close to 1, that's probably still in the expected range for BA.2. If they keep climbing...that's not so good.But, South Africa never saw a bump, and they've been mainly BA.2 for like 2 months. Netherlands has been trending down for weeks. Germany just started trending down this week. UK is flat/starting to come down. South Korea is finally coming down.This coming week will be important in telling if the US is essentially over the whole omicron wave, or if BA.2 is going to be a problem.And since nothing new has thus far shown up, we might potentially be at the end of the pandemic. (But, it only takes one new variant to pop up to put us right back in.)"
"Add all of that together with the fact that the first BA.2 case was found in the US back in December and I think it?s probably safe to say we will just see a ?wave? and not a ?surge?.There are plenty of people that clamor over these types of headlines, but two years of these headlines and all the time spent on social media really warps peoples sense of reality.Check out r/coronavirusillinois if you want to see some out of touch individuals regarding numbers. There?s a reason that sub has more subscribers than almost any state/country COVID-specific sub."
That is good to here.
"Wastewater surveillance fixes this problem. I wish it was standard in every town/city, and not just for covid. We should be using it to detect all kinds of things."
"Exactly that. They sent all the at home tests to say ""numbers are low, get back to work!"""
"And who cares? Why are we again, making case counts the end all be all? If hospitalizations don?t rise at the same rate then again, why should we care?"
I think unvaxxed people were about twice as likely to test positive and about 10x more likely to get hospitalized during the omicron peak. A lot of vaccinated people (myself included) mysteriously tested negative after being directly exposed to people who tested positive ? probably just because the vaccines were doing their job
"I don't think there are that many unvaxxed people who haven't caught Covid yet, except for maybe some who are ineligible for vaccination and thus have to take extreme measures to shelter (and they'll continue to shelter). I wouldn't expect to see much of a difference in infection rate between vaxxed and unvaxxed at all. Risk of severe disease may still be different though."
Of course it is. The at home testing is to deflate the numbers of actual reporting. The government want this shit done with.
"That's week over week, I believe.week 0: 1week 1: 1.3week 2: 1.3^2 = 1.69week 3: 1.3^2 = 2.197week 4: 1.3^4 = 2.8561week 5: 1.3^5 = 3.71293week 6: 1.3^6 = 4.826809etc.Doubling every 3 weeks is certainly better than doubling every 3 days or every week, but it is still exponential growth. The question is: do hospitalization and fatalities follow the same pattern and for how long will the trend continue?Just a few weeks? Several months?"
It's going in the wrong direction.
Also..>COVID Hospitalizations Rise in LA Countyhttps://www.nbclosangeles.com/news/local/covid-hospitalizations-rise-in-la-county/2856703/
Beauty of removing a mandate is that it doesn't make masks illegal.
"Yes, let?s"
Work ?we need to start talking about coming back into the office 100%?*later that day*HR ?out of caution we are informing you a person in the office tested positive for Covid?What a joke. Mask mandate ending =/= Covid is over.
"L.A. resident here - my family is still diligently masking. Haven't had it, don't want it. :P"
Yes just like we have for the last > year?
"My county has a population of ~ a million. 7-day avg 157 cases (total, not incidence rate), hospitals are not stressed, one death in last seven days. So yes, don?t mind if we do."
We aren?t pretending it?s over because it is over
Lol south America is not wealthy and it has more people vaccinated and boosted already than USA. Pandemic is pretty much over in Brazil. Concerts happening and mandate masks being lifted
"That?s great to hear! It?s wonderful when people have positive outcomes after infection! Many people were infected with alpha and delta and were completely asymptomatic! The virus has still killed millions of people though, so personal anecdotes cannot be generally applied."
Shenzhen is down to single-digit cases. Can Shanghai do it too?
"Yep. It's a blatant ""they are superior to you"" double standard applied to health and safety. Crock of horseshit."
"But when the player can?t play, but can sit in the front row without a mask on and watch his team play, that?s just an insane optic.I?m pro vaccine, but it?s just weird looking and hard to justify"
Exactly.
But players from visiting teams didn?t have to be vaccinated. Kylie Irving from the Brooklyn nets could literally sit in the stands right near the court and be permitted to be there but couldn?t play in the game BUT an unvaccinated player from another city could? That?s the law of unintended consequences and it ended up making no sense.
Kyrie was getting way too much attention
The rule was stupid as it is. Like you mention about the workers have to vaccinated but yet unvaccinated players can still go to games and watch their team play court side..So this whole situation didn't make much sense.
Rules for thee and not for me.  What a disgrace.
Or they could just get rid of it for everyone
"There should not be a mandate, and this shows exactly what is wrong with these mandates. Us lower echelon individuals are forced comply or risk getting fired or barred from places, but if you have enough influence you can get your way. This is what all the idiots are rooting for, more government to divide us into ""important"" and ""unimportant"" people."
I bet people stop showing up to games if the vendors and janitors strike.
Visiting players can be unvaccinated so this argument doesn?t apply.
How about no one has to be vaccinated? I'm vaccinated but people shouldnt lose their livelihood because of it.
This only fuels the conspiracy theorist.
"When it was just Kyrie Irving and his fans complaining about the rule and how it affected athletes, the mayor was a tough guy about it and wouldn't back down. As soon as the baseball lockout ended and Hal Steinbrenner and  Steve ""I donated 1.5 million to your campaign"" Cohen came knocking, he changed his tune.The mayor knows who signs his checks."
It should be all
"Not sure what election you were watching, but he seemed like an asshole to plenty of us the whole time, which is why we didn't vote for him."
> he just seems like an assholeHe was a NYPD officer for 20 years.  I'd have been surprised if he wasn't.
I thought that vibe was really apparent in the primary and his skin of his teeth victory suggests a lot of other people did as well. I don't understand what people saw.
I honestly don't see why anyone thought a cop would make a good mayor.
"He's a complete fucking moron, and has been since day 1. Oh I wish to god Kathryn Garcia had won the primary (final runoff was 50.4% vs 49.6%, with ~7,000 votes separating the two). She would have done so much good for the city in her own right, to say nothing of in comparison to Adams."
Can you explain your opposition to this decision?
Should?ve been Kathryn Garcia. Would?ve been good for us and good for her.
[impossible]
"Adams came so close to losing, too. But he'll probably sail to reelection no matter what. Maybe NYC will have a good mayor in the 30s..."
"> There is mass contradictions when it comes to the vaccine requirements and I wish it just sense for everyone.Yeah, make everyone vaccinate. Period."
Not even. This is all about the Yankees
The rule was changed because Baseball is starting. Nobody in New York cares about the Nets.
"Well, if Kyrie was honest about standing in solidarity against mandates for all the people that lost jobs over the mandates, he should still not be playing home games, right?"
"As much as I don?t like Kyrie, I don?t think you can primarily attribute this to him (definitely partially). He?d been sitting for so long and no one was budging?until it was time for baseball to start. The Yankees have a lot of pull and the face of the franchise isn?t vaccinated. I?m sure the Mets also had a Kyrie-level of influence since they have at least one guy who isn?t vaccinated, but I?m pinning this mostly on Aaron Judge and the Yankees. And it disappoints the hell out of me because Judge is so wholesome and beloved and one of my favorite players I?ve ever gotten to watch on my favorite team, who has now revealed himself as a selfish dickbag who CLEARLY knew they?d get the City to break for him because he seemingly had no concerns about not being able to play. Have fun not being able to play any of our games in Toronto, Mr. ?Team Player?."
I?ve seen it described as a legal concern over regulating interstate commerce (if reference to the similar mandate and exemptions in SF).  I think they are afraid to open it up to lawsuits.
"Yes, it's hypocrisy, but that's not how any of the major sports leagues work. What in the world are you talking about in that ""teams won't come?"""
The issue is they already allow unvaccinated players from other teams play and allow unvaccinated fans to site 10 feet away from them. It was pointless to not allow kyrie to play.
r/NBA has had it covered all year
just January?
you must not watch basketball if you somehow missed all the Kyrie anti-vax drama
Sometimes the simple solution is the best solution.
What about the people that got fired over not being vaccinated? Will they be re-hired?
The vaccines don't protect against the current variants. Who cares. It's like getting a swine flu vaccine when the influenza b is running through the community. It's a shame nurses hold opinions beyond the scope of their expertise.
"So say your partisan overlords, well done submitting your free will to them."
Please share with us your findings on the risk this disease poses to professional athletes
Literally nothing. The omicron variant is literally non-lethal.
Because they cannot mandate it for visiting unvaccinated players. It?s a double standard
It has nothing to do with the Nets and everything to do with the Yankees and Mets.
What an idiotic comment
"Literally in Chicago (where I live) there was a very long time (over a year) where you could schedule a health professional to come to your home or anywhere and vaccinate up to 10 individuals. They also gave each person a $100 SNAP (food stamps) gift card to each person. We still never hit 80% vaccination. There is nothing else the government could ever be expected to do. If anyone has any other ideas, share it."
What about boosters? Evidence is showing waning immunity from both second vaccine and third shots. It?s pretty clear we?ll need a fourth shot if we want to avoid future surges.
The remaining unvaccinated will never one. I would guess the exception is if their employer mandates it.
There are no approved vaccines for children under five.
"Well, that's only half-true. I guess a lot of people would want a fourth shot, but can't get any."
Crappy to hear
Boston?
"Never, EVER presume to think the government will give two shits about you or the rest of the ""peasants""."
Like space force
I think it?s RemindMe! 6 months
Idiocracy all the way down
Very wise.
"The article's not about masks or social distancing.It's about the closure of vaccine sites, shortages of 4th boosters and reduced availability of tests in the near future.I'll also add that, due to Congress denying Covid funding extensions, treatment supplies will remain short as well.Even without a new evil variant, it appears our clinical protections are going away."
"This casual acceptance of people dying en masse is half the problem. Socializing isn?t worth human lives, end of."
>Those who are vaccinated are. Those who aren?t are adults who will live or die with their choice. Those who are vaccinated will live or die with their choice too.
"Not everyone feels the need to ""socialize"" that badly. Really hate how we're being forced back to the office with this shitty reason being used."
"> Until there?s a variety that is both more contagious and more severe people aren?t going back to broad restrictions. Yes, people will accept broad restrictions when the situation requires it, and not when it doesn?t. Not sure why that?s a problem?"
"you guys have been saying this since masks came off in february and nothing has come of it. all this article is saying is that we?re getting rid of mass vaccination sites. good, because we don?t need them, you can get them at CVS if you still haven?t gotten one for whatever reason."
"All of them. If we went all-out and hit the virus as hard as we can, we could eliminate it almost completely by starving it out. Isolated pockets would remain, but they could be dealt with in a more targeted manner. Instead, what we?ve done is try to compromise with a deadly virus for two years, and it?s accomplished a whole lot of nothing."
Ever watch the bubble boy movie.
Ah the whole head in the sand approach.
"Uh, ?all the others? are ?free? if you have health insurance or federal- or state-run health coverage."
"As much as I agree that the CDC hasn?t followed the science, I don?t think the CDC?s incompetence is what drove a huge percentage of Americans to distrust scientists.Quick reminder that something like 63% of Americans think Joe Biden is responsible for rising gas prices. I think the problem is just that people are dumb and we need a huge overhaul of our education system."
Proportionately it?s a big increase. Comparing it to the worst of omicron is not that helpful. We hopefully won?t get back there again.
That's a huge increase
This could be the beginning of the surge the UK just had
Good news doesn?t sell.
Well I have some bad news for you; deaths usually come weeks after your first positive covid test. You can see for yourself that the omicron wave caused the second highest waves of deaths in the united states.
"Covid damages the heart, even if you?re asymptomatic unfortunately. I just don?t want to get sick at all, though i fear i already did at one point"
"I keep telling everyone I'm not the problem, my feelings, my depression is normal.  It's this fucked up world that need the help."
Well said.
Agreed.
Maybe the cure is to not pay attention then
"You forgot climate change.I hate this timeline, somebody take me back to 30 years ago."
"And the bad part is that this is true at both sides of the Atlantic. Inflation here in the Netherlands is rampant but we barely see any compensation, or worse: the rich are compensated more than the poor and car owners are compensated at the expense of those using sustainable transit and cyclists. Minimum wages are frozen for 10 years, new student gifts will be the lowest in 15 years, not even taking inflation into account. This while we had to stay home when offices were allowed to be open all along during the pandemic here. Still we were frowned upon every single time we turned the volume up when older generations did the same without being frowned upon. The elderly were in absolute fear about the virus itself while pensions aren't indexed. Generation X escaped all responsibility and does now too as they are the rich car drivers subsidized by cycling students and pension-starved elderly."
Currently don?t feel like I have anything to look forward to any more.
You forgot student loan forgiveness
TrueBut honestly Trump and January 6th were even more damaging to my psycheIt?s not just the pandemic that has been so difficult - it?s been one thing after another
"maybe this is just me projecting negative feelings onto others, but I feel like a lot (a minority by percentage, but like, maybe 20% of the population or so) of people went through the pandemic and out the other side *better* than they went in.lots of members of the pmc got to shift work schedules more to home, saving them gas, giving them more time, etc.low wage workers have gotten so absolutely screwed that it's murderously enraging. How there haven't been more mass shootings and fucking mcdonalds, walmart, amazon warehouses, etc, I'll never know."
"Trauma may also not set in until after the person feels safe. There was some talk about that early on, but not very much and it kinda got swept under the rug. But even if the problem isn't at the level of trauma, you can't just switch it off."
I?m still in survival mode at work. It?s hard to adapt at the moment.
Agreed. There's a bunch of it that's emotional and trauma. But a good percentage of what's going on is also a realization that even during a crisis... maybe even.. *especially* doing a crisis.. the rich just... get richest. It's much more unfair than we ever knew it was possible.
"Might also be the fact that people are realising that their effort could have been in vain with governments opening up too soon, focusing on money over lives"
This
"Everyone I know/know of struggling with depression in the pandemic (distinct from people who are depressed prior to it) had a partner, parent, sibling, cousin or child die of Covid  Some of the worst cases of depression I'm aware of directly infected the loved one who died.   Some of those are children in K-12 who brought it home from school and it orphaned themGrief and guilt are pretty powerful"
I?m really struggling to remember what I used to like to actually DO for hobbies. I remember the person I WAS before and I want that person back?Ironically we caught and recovered from Covid for the first time this last week? but after this upcoming week of sitting around because we can?t go out and risk infecting others I?m just going to throw myself and my family into trying new things.
> Is it okay if I take my mask off to eat? sad
Literally! I thought by the time lockdown was over the virus would?ve been eradicated. It seems like the government wants this pandemic to be ongoing because of how much they?re benefiting from it. Then the amount of people who don?t mind living with an airborne destructive virus is mind blowing.
"Previous post was removed for being purely political, but COVID very early on was highly politicized to begin with. Everything about the election supercharged the negative emotions due to COVID."
"for me, the chief issue is the lack of financial and other forms of support from the government, as well as individual communities."
"I'm part of the reverse group. parts of me sees that these measures are necessary but that everyone's getting tired of it and dropping it. That irrationality due to fatigue scares me. These are protections, we are dropping them as a society instead of working to make them more livable."
"Exactly. The recent studies on masks regarding their efficiency against the latest variants show that individual N95?s provide longer protection (2.5 hours) than universal cloth or surgical mask wearing (30 min-1hr). While it was necessary for everyone to mask for much of the pandemic, that individual N95 protection timeframe suggests it can now be a personal choice in many situations. Yet this new data is ignored by many here. I suspect there is another side to the mental health crisis where certain people are having a hard time with this and are afraid of seeing unmasked faces in public after being told an uncovered face was a source of danger for nearly 2 years."
Lol yeah that just solves everything. /r/thanksimcured
Pay wall though

no questions!!!!!
Half the county didn't care that a million people died. Wouldn't care if 10 million died.
I have a distinct recollection of the first four days in quarantine when at least myself and everyone I knew were doing our absolute best. The rest of it...
"They should have picked that up, but in reality Worldometers is only an indicator of deaths, as countries all over the world are under reporting, evident by the large discrepancies in the excess death numbers."
"Good catch, shame on worldometers. That?s a rookie mistake"
"Hillary Clinton only recently caught it, and I think of that as a metaphor for her realism and competence compared to Trump, who caught it so early and exposed like the whole white house as well as the whole country."
FALSE
"It's going to completely disappear very soon, almost as if by magic..."
The NYT has the death count at 975K
Officially. India undoubtedly crossed the million mark during their Delta wave.
Ik right!
"""Talking about things my brain doesn't comprehend makes me vewy angry."""
"The same thing was and is happening to me since 2015. Just talking about climate change and climate collapse was bringing so much ugliness out of people. Now, since covid started I just don't talk to anyone - I'm afraid of this hatred and anti intellectualism."
Anti intellectualism went from being a niche to being something populist politicians boost and encourage.In the UK famously during the brexit debate the leave side shutdown all discourse from experts trying to explain that trade is super complicated and good relations with our nearest neighbours is important with a simple phrase People have had enough of experts.A phrase met with cheers by many. A real sad state of affairs that it appears to be getting worse
"<3 im sorry people are terrible, you're not alone on that... stick around for the few who aren't..."
It's not the whole planet.  It does seem to be a few entire states though.
"Yeah my wife is a PhD Biologist and we have consistently been more careful with mask wearing, seeing people, going to restaurants, etc. than any of our family and they all complain and think we?re nuts. But we?re also among the few who haven?t caught Covid yet, soooo?"
Don't look up.
Dante?s Peak comes to mind.
"> since Covid started it became a political issue Can I just point out that using the impersonal voice here makes it sound like this ""just happened"" when in fact> since Covid started it *was made* a political issueThis was done *deliberately*, and it was done in order to sow chaos and division. And it worked."
"Doing what science and the medical community recommends is not political, this is not a both sides issue. One side is rejecting factual reality. It's like global warming. What sort of form fixing it takes, like  carbon markets or subsidizing green energy, is politics. Questioning whether objective reality exists is mental illness"
"People are dumb and will be swindled easily into believing nonsense, just think about how much support and influence people like Alex Jones have. Mass hysteria and delusion, not a lot of reason or critical thought left"
The divisivness is world wide my friend
"It?s less a political issue, and more of a greed issue now. Businesses don?t want any attention paid to Covid, and so now neither party wants to acknowledge it. Especially when both parties have massively failed in the handling of it."
Who could have foreseen subject matter experts with years of specialized education and advanced degrees under their belts knowing what they're talking about? /s
">If any scientist can read this, please know I really wanna know the truth, no matter how harsh is it, I don't want to die without knowing what killed me.Also we love you and thank you for your hard work"
"As a scientist, the hurdles and sacrifices we went through to do what we do won?t stop us doing our work. What the bad part/consequences are though is that it leads to less engagement with the public/non-scientists,  which is what is more and more needed. Especially in critical human health affecting issues such as covid and climate change"
The way we avoid vigilante justice in society is by having a functional justice system which holds criminals accountable. We can start with grand juries over mishandling of epidemic prevention policy.
"my company fired all of them, thankfully"
"They take it out on anyone and anything that does anything to make them doubt thier belief that covid isn't serious and they should be taking it seriously. They are terrified underneath it all and in a state of fragile denial over it. They don't want to hear science, or scientists, or see data, or talk about login covid affects. If they just bury their heads in the sand, it will all be fine."
Have you met the green guy scientists... But yeah.. he the only brutal scientists..oh wait i think there more..
"the part that people also don't get, is yes, they are often not correct or speak in open ended terms with everything in it's infancy... but its constantly evolving"
"Fuck stupid people, my tolerance for them is getting lower every day."
"People who have trouble empathizing with neighbors, classmates, co-workers also have trouble empathizing with complete strangers that they watch or read about in media.Then asking them to change any little detail of their lives elicits the response ""YOU CAN'T FORCE ME TO CARE!""Unfortunately, anything in our future that requires *timely* collective action is doomed to failure because these people will fight against it."
">  He then tells me what's the point of getting vaccinated if it doesn't prevent you getting sick and other sick... I've used the seatbelt analogy: vaccines are seatbelts and car crashes are covid.  Seatbelts can't prevent car crashes - they don't have that power.  But if you are in a car crash, seatbelts improve survival odds and reduces the risk serious injury.  Wearing a seatbelt can make the difference between walking away from a car crash or living with life changing injuries such as brain damage or dying. And to push the analogy even more: Not being buckled in endangers others in the car during a crash. Anything ricocheting inside the car is a danger but humans have these big bowling ball heads - which, if flying around - are a danger to other people's skulls."
"We live in a ""postfactual age"" (no idea if I translated this correctly)Many cuts to public education, a political & ideological focus on toxic individuality and the fact, that personal believes can follow the behaviour that would be supported by it. It's difficult to believe that we can be different, although it is possible, of course."
"There is one simple trick to built trust, it is to be honest and don't try to manipulate, be open about you might be wrong, but you think it is correct. Don't ever ignore peoples worries even if you think they have no merrit."
It?s not straightforward. Are there any long term studies that show that there are no long term side effects?  Just asking questions.
I think the irony of your comment is probably lost on you.
Didn't yall have covid jails?
>Should be a modern country run by modern poeple like Zuck and Besos.It kind of is and that's a lot of why we're in this mess.
Have you seen their education system?
"Because science also say disagreeable things about evolution, reproduction, mysticism (thinking of crystals, auras and the like) and medical guidelines of all types.The article clearly stated it was across the political spectrum."
"I am very low risk.But my parents and in-laws are all in their 60s-70s, and really all of them are pretty healthy and low risk overall except for age. They?re all going to get the second booster. My mother in law is a working nurse so she?s in the hospital every day, but for the rest of the family it?s more of a ?why not? Anything helps? attitude."
Yup. I'll get any booster that's available. I'd be fine with getting it each year like the flu shot.
"I am planning to. I had my booster in November. If/when it becomes available to me I will get it. If it becomes a yearly or every six months thing I will do it because my vaccine side effects have been very mild (mainly just super sore shoulder muscles) compared to what others have experienced, so for me it's not much of an inconvenience. I get a flu vaccine yearly too. I have yet to have covid (or if I had covid, it was asymptomatic)."
"Yes. I figure I'll be exposed and probably infected, sooner or later. I also figure less lasting damage will be done if I have another shot first."
Just got second booster to give my baby some protection before he's born next month.
"I just recently did a platelet donation after a long hiatus during the initial stages of the pandemic. The Red Cross is currently running SARS-CoV-2 antibody testing on all blood product donations.Mine came back ""Reactive+"" which in their parlance means my Ab titers are high enough that they consider my plasma suitable for convalescent plasma donation (to the extent that ever actually happens) despite never (to my knowledge) having actually had COVID. I'm 4+ months out from my booster. Moderna x3.You can donate platelets up to 24x a year. I'm hoping to get back to doing it regularly, and to answer your question, I will probably get a second booster, if approved for 30+ without underlying comorbidities, once that drops."
Yes. Get in my body. I live with 2 at risk people and am in contact with even more. I'll be doing my part for my community and tribe.
Sure. Why not?
"I got booster day after it was available, because Omicron was coming. I've had Vaxzevria and Spikevax, so maybe I'll get Nuvaxovid for 4th shot, so I've got a spread portfolio."
"Probably will get it. I?m relatively healthy and young, but I do have asthma and live with someone who is immunocompromised. There doesn?t seem to be much downside to getting the shot, and enough upside that it would be worth it. It feels like we?ll just be getting a Covid shot regularly from now on, like with the flu shot (which I also get every year for the same reasons)"
"I'm low risk but I'ma still get it. I couldn't live with myself if I got someone's mom or granny sick, a day of joint pain is a small price to pay."
"Yes; don?t worry  about getting sick but if it at all reduces the chance of Long Covid, it?s worth the 24 hours of feeling like ass"
"I'm debating. And i need more expert data. On the one hand, there's patently an improvement in protection, even if slight. The more protection to more people, the sooner this can all be over (spread slows down even more, the hospitalization can drop, so on so forth). On the other hand, it isn't completely necessary. There may be detriments with regard to protection if you overboost with a working immune system. And lastly, we may want to train the immune system to a universal or anti-omicron version of the vaccine (if they come out). It's not clear cut for healthy people at all and its reflected in the talking points of the FDA. We are in the fog of war with this topic."
"No. Every study I?ve seen so far has shown that people like me in their 30s still have adequate protection against hospitalization/death from the first booster, so if I?m going to get another booster any time soon it?s going to because of either some scary new variant takes over or a different vaccine comes out that actually protects against infection better."
"No, most likely not.Considering I?m already vaccinated and boosted, and after previous covid infection and very healthy and in good shape, I don?t really need it.Also my reaction to the third dose was brutal with really high fever. Will recommend the fourth dose to my parents tho. I think it?s generally proven to be safe and makes a lot of sense for those at risk. For me, not so much."
Not unless the guidance changes. I had a ?natural? second booster about three weeks ago so I?m not too worried right now.
"If I become eligible, sure. I wish they would make more effective vaccines but if getting another booster of this kind of vaccines will help me stay out of the hospital, that's enough incentive for me to take it."
"No, I didn't get the 3rd either though. Until a vaccine is created for current strains, or it actually prevents transmission to a high degree, ill stick with my 2 shots. 25 M."
Taking every booster they have!  Must protect nana.  But mostly I?m concerned about the littles who still can?t get vaccinated.
Leaning towards not. I had a terrible reaction to the last one.
"Sure, I'm not in the high risk group for flu anymore, but I still get the flu shot each year.Furthermore, at least my 2 year old can get a flu shot. It's unfortunately imperfect, but staying current on vaccination will always reduce household transmission, as opposed to not being current."
"Absolutely I will. I clean windows for a living, both residential cleaning and commercial, so I'm in the public pretty much 100% of the time. I also don't want to risk giving Covid to a customer/get it from a customer."
God bless you. I can't imagine what you've been through
~6 months
We ?? obviously ?? don't ?? care ?? in ?? this ?? country ?? duh
Need a vaccine with data it's safe and effective for them presumably.
That and wear masks.
"Here in Canada, we were told that COVID was over when 70% of the population was vaccinated. Then it was over when 70% had their first dose and 80% had two doses. Then it was 80% with two doses. Then it was 90% with two doses. Then it was when everyone had a booster. That was the point where people started questioning the narrative with the never-ending shifting of goalposts and the authorities eventually walked back and ended restrictions, including vaccine mandates (with the exception of federal travel regulations). We finished with about 90% of the population fully vaccinated and about half boosted. Yet the COVID lobby, in full panic mode over the return of normality, is now pushing *fourth* shots for everyone? No, I won?t be getting that one. But thanks."
2 weeks to bend the curve.
>Just in time for BA.2. Great timing!Downvoted for spoiling the party. COVID IS OVER OVER OVER OVER OVER STOP TALKING ABOUT IT /s
"Something tells me the parents of the kids that DO die aren't gonna feel too much better when people talk about ""the low death rate in children"" to them......I mean hell, 0.35% of all kids in the USA dying would still be pretty devastating, numbers wise, it would mean \~255 000 deaths."
But it the conclusions hold once reviewed and substantiated... Do we panic then?
"Just now getting over a sinus infection I thought was for sure covid. 4 rapid tests at home starting about 2 days after symptoms, and finally a PCR at the docs office this past Thursday. All negative. To be fair, it could be covid, but it's prevalence is so much lower currently. Could be a simple cold. I've had symptoms for about 6 days now - much better however....."
"Take 2 home tests morning and evening. I was in a similar boat, tested negative on Oct and first home test but positive on the second home test. Then my symptoms got way worse."
"It's definitely possible if not likely that you have COVID. In my bout with Omicron, I had a fever and flulike symptoms for 2.5 days and tested negative during that span. Decided to get tested again after I was starting to feel better just in case... and it came up positive."
"This is anti intellectualism in the US hard at work, these people are trying their darnedest to take over whatever positions of influence that they can"
Immediately thought of the Illinois covid subreddit when I saw this.
"The pfizer doses are all the same, 30 mcg.  Moderna is 100 mcg and 50 for the booster (though some people are still getting the larger 100 mcg dose there).Pfizer and moderna have phase 2/3s of an Omicron-targeting vaccine running.  We have no results, including any phase 1 results even.  I would assume an Omicron booster will be absurdly effective against Omicron once we do begin giving them, but this is months off at best.  Omicron boosters, if they work, would then bring back high sterilization and prevent Omicron spread society-wide for quite some time.At that age I'd probably just get a moderna dose ASAP, but with the uncertainty about future boosters it is a bit of a crapshoot."
"No, there's no evidence that infants get any protection through breast milk.  The milk does contain some antibodies, but that's not absorbed into the bloodstream or in any way able to reach the lungs.  It would help against virus in the gut (Omicron can cause gastrointestinal issues)."
You're fine to go mask free if you're boosted.
"Coronaviruses existed prior to covid 19, it's likely antibodies from another coronavirus"
Cross reactivity from infection with a similar Coronavirus.
"Antigen tests and PCR just look for the presence of bits of the virus.  They can keep showing (almost always weak) positives for some time after recovery.  We have no way to tell if you're actually contagious at this point, however.  By the time the viral load is dropping a lot of it is probably neutralized, so the assumption is that nearly everyone is not contagious."
"I was told specifically not to test by the doh, that I could have a positive for up to 90 days."
"This is not literature but this happened to me. I stopped testing until week 3, after which I tested negative."
This report is Guangdong (shenzhen province) and not Shanghai.
"No, it's just more localized lockdowns rather than whole cities."
After 2+ years but yeah. It's a good start at least
"FOSUN and BioNTech have been seeking approval for the Comirnaty vaccine in mainland China for almost a year, and they still haven't received it."
"In 2021, the CCP ran a pretty hard propaganda against the US created mRNA and J&J vaccines. Their media portrayed them as dangerous with a lot of side effects. Importing those vaccines now would create some major hurdles. The first would be having to walk back all the negative coverage in 2021 and admitting they were wrong, which the CCP will never do. Also, many people would no be suspicious and you'd have to convince them anew that the vaccines are actually good."
"It didn't matter, a lot of people were not wearing masks during Chinese new year families gatherings then after CNY, cases just started to sky rocket.I believe a lot of infections happened when people are at home not wearing masks."
"Masks can't stop spread at home, or in eateries. Doubly so if people are asymptomatic, not even knowing they have it, and hence aren't taking precautions."
Yes. But we?re talking surgical masks or other masks that are not well fitting respirator masks.
"Masks aren?t as effective as a lot of people think, especially against Omicron.  N95s likely work reasonably well provided they are properly used (which is rare), but surgical masks are of dubious efficacy in real world settings and cloth masks are useless."
But it?s not inevitable if one uses the time to get people vaccinated and boosted and improve air quality and ventilation.
So horse-paste (ivermectin) wasn't what we needed.  What we really needed was to shoot ourselves up with llama blood.  I can't wait to see what the anti-vaxxers do with this new info.

"Considering the teacher death tolls I've heard in the south, sometimes the death is very literal"
I imagine it's going to be federally mandated for students in public schools at some point.
It?s not just that. My wife is in sales and her coworker isn?t vaxxed. Many clients require vaccination so she literally can?t go into appointments. It then falls on other people to pick up the slack. It?s bullshit.
Plus the employee loss from people not wanting to work in a Covid unsafe environment.My workplace has kept both vaccine and mask requirements because we have enough people who would quit if they were removed.
"I disagree. In retrospect i totally see what happened. Anti vax employees were stalling like crazy, hoping and waiting for the court cases and the antivirals to be approved. When paxlovid was approved i knew the mandates were dead. It wasn't a perfect drug, but it was perfect for the argument of 'mandates were no longer needed', you can take personal responsibility. on top of that, companies will do the absolute minimum for legal obligation. While the CDC had 'tough rules' the companies played ball - they may have been legally obligated if you got sick during the crisis. The moment CDC relaxed it, they took everything down. Keep in mind, companies have sick time slack, they don't actually care about you specifically. They lowered quarantine time with corporate pressure, it has never completely been about your individual safety. You can be infected, you can be very sick, but the moment you are 'adequate' you are expected back to work. They can handle sick-outs of a certain amount by pressuring existing healthy employees. Which is exactly what they did. Remember what happened to health care workers. No PPE, No relief, No hazard pay, No vacation, Mandatory vaccination, Mandatory reporting. When they need you - they will push you to the limit. When they don't need you, they owe you nothing. Americans need to remember, companies see you as a resource. Do not believe they care about you, do not care about them. Always think decisions from the lens of an executive who thinks you are just a resource to be managed, not that you are human."

Vaccines dont stop that.
I 100% agree with it.  They do it with smokers.  Do it with people who refuse to get vaccinated (barring actual legitimate medical reasons).
Long COVID scares me much more than death. Every decent article should mention this in great detail.

">If you think that?ll stop with COVID you?re nutsIt?s not about stopping COVID-19, it?s about preventing hospitalizations.They don?t give a shit if you get sick, they just don?t want to pay for your hospital stay."

"Antiavax propaganda. Lots of it has been traced back to Russia. They use it to desabalize the west. Lots of other reasons too, but this is a big one that not enough people know about."
Unheard yes but not gone. They?ll just move to the same choke point all other vaccines sit on: school and child activity enrollment. Where almost no one thinks about or objects to them. (This assumes that they end up with a long term COVID vaccine and don?t need yearly updates to it like flu.)
"The flu vaccine is a good comparison, though.  There are so many flu strains that the vaccines are ""only"" moderately effective (with no downside).  A lot of people never bothered.  I personally didn't until Swine flu hit, and I the olds were immune because they had antibodies from like 60 years earlier.  Now I think of flu vaccine like pokemon: gotta catch em all.  I know that's not how most people think of it though, it's basically rare for average people to get flu vaccines.The covid vaccines, however, are WAY more effective, both at reducing personal illness and at reducing the spread (contagious time and viral load).  I think there's a very good chance that businesses continue to mandate vaccines, even if for selfish reasons.  No one wants half their workforce out for 2+ weeks during the holiday season, when a shot (or nasal mist, possibly coming soon) will trivially protect them.  Add on the risk to customers, and risk of losing customers to fear of illness, and there's ample reason for businesses to care about getting their workers vaccinated.That said, I fully expect summer to be YOLO unless another strain hits especially hard.  Next winter is likely to be the ""aw shit, here we go again"" moment."
"Well I know where I live, vaccine mandates or proving proof of vaccination is non existent. I'm an adult with no kids in school, so I can't speak to that."
"influenza vaccine, cough cough.kill the old iguess? Way to be you."
Exactly.   Midterm elections are killing the pandemic.  Democrats will be slaughtered if they keep pressing forced medical procedures.
So you are saying covid won?t be seasonal?
"Yes, that's what we need. Insurance companies having even more power over people's health"
You mean the ones that aren t dead or disabled? Because it?s only reasonable to subtract those people that have been harmed long term for their ignorant anti-vaxx beliefs.
"So I'll answer a poster who's post was deleted by Reddit.  He said 'unvaccinated, but prior infection' was vastly inferior to vaccination immunity.  I say see here:[https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/71/wr/mm7104e1.htm](https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/71/wr/mm7104e1.htm)Scroll to the end of the report and look at the big chart.  Find the curve for unvaccinated with prior infection and you'll find it all the way at the bottom, overlaying the line for vaccinated with prior infection and below (better) than vaccination only.IE With prior infection the CDC found your hospitalization risk the same whether or not you vaccinate.  Don't believe me...read the chart.This does not mean you shouldn't vaccinate.  It's the safest way to get immunity.  But it does mean that natural immunity works for those who have it."
Natural immunity isn?t nearly as strong or as long as vaccine and boosters. So why would they count it as being vaccinated. Can you post latest findings?
"I do believe in natural immunity - but so far, there is no way of verifying that someone has already had covid, and which type (because immunity from orior sttains like delta does not makenyou immune from omicron). Until that happens, vaccines are the best way to insure that you have minimal symptoms if you get infected with omicron."
Gee it sure is a good thing the pandemic is over /s
"These aren't translating into more in ICU though - there are currently about 30 in Scotland. Previous wave peaks were 200, 150 and 100.Weekly excess deaths are also at normal pre-pandemic levels, as with the rest of western Europe. Very different in eastern Europe though, where low vax levels mean Omicron is resulting in a lot of deaths.Edit: sorry, written too quickly, meant not ""ICU beds"", but ""ICU vent beds"". In past waves that figure always indicates deaths are going to spike."
Despite vaccinations disease is highest it ever has been and yet people on reddit still jerk how corona is harmless.
"Hopefully a good thing.  Assuming no corresponding proportionate increase in death rate, the omnipotence of a weak strain should ensure the next dominant mutation is more harmless.  Then we really can LIVE with it."

Did you get Paxlovid with a prescription? I?m booking a trip to the UK for May/June and am planning to go to museums and covid makes me nervous given they?ve pulled back restrictions. Aside from wearing a mask not sure what else I can do aside from bring some meds with me in case I get it

As of end of feb only 50% of the UK had been infected. Probably new infections due to Ba2
"I mean, it looks like many (not all of course) governments are keen on allowing people to party anyway. Some European countries are lifting mask mandates and other restrictions despite rising and record high cases. Ever since Omicron something has changed, I haven?t seen restrictions lifted like this before. With Delta they were primarily lifted when the cases dropped and many European countries and certain counties/states in the US still kept mask mandates."
"I still don't understand why overpopulation isn't the main topic of discussion. This is nature's way of fighting it.Edit: wow didn?t expect this. Oh well, thanks for the replies I?ll read up more about it."

"Couldnt have said it better myself. As a matter of fact one doesnt need to scroll further than this post for people saying ""but ICU didnt go up"". I even recognize usernames from before delta saying we wouldnt need further NPIs and still using the same arguments nowadays..smh"
"I'm frustrated, but also don't understand how we can get past it. Even if the White House wants to do something, the CDC or congress ties their hands. Obviously we don't know who is controlling whom, we all assumed the White House is pressuring the CDC and the FDA, but then the agencies defy each other on a regular basis over both minutia and major policies (See latest on 4th dose announcements). It's a mess. The vaccines are amazing, we are incredibly lucky to have them. But they aren't perfect since their protectiveness dropped from the original 90+%, and most people in the US are unhealthy and blunts its effectiveness even further (and, obviously the unvax are driving the majority of it). Even if the successive waves get smaller over a long period of time, the sheer number of people getting sick at the same time is going to do economic and health care damage that we all have to pay for. I'm shocked that it's cheaper (politically and economically) to stress our systems than it is to just prevent it from happening."
It?s so fucking frustrating isn?t it!? Total face palm moment every time.
"It was nice knowing nobody, too."
"The way out is ensuring there's enough vaccines, monoclonal antibodies, and antiviral treatments, and that they are easy to get."
Masks and vaccines work incredibly well. What is your source?The US is a terrible example because of the high level of noncompliance.But I thought the UK had higher vaccine compliance?
"It doesn't ""end"". I'm not sure what people expect to happen at this point. This is life now. There was pre covid life and now there is post covid life. Doing anything aside from getting vaccinated when you need to and staying healthy is basically pointless at this point for most people. Restrictions, mandates, etc, it's all meaningless. Covid is here. We're not getting rid of it. We can barely control it. Hope one day we have very successful treatments that are close to a cure. If you want some extra protection wear a mask. if you're very vulnerable alter your life accordingly."
"Uhm..masks work even better against omicron than against delta..https://twitter.com/BagheriMos/status/1482019024678621185?cxt=HHwWgsC4xe2cmJEpAAAA> With masks for Omicron, the upper bound of infection risk is lower than Delta. We assumed that Omicron is three times more infectious than Delta and is mainly in the URT. We ran the same model as for Omicron. [...] To clarify more: risk of infection for Omicron is lower than Delta if EVERYONE is masked (but not zero!) assuming Omicron is really a URT variant (which early data shows to be the case). In any other scenario Omicron risk is higher since it is more infectious. [...]Restrictions also work as has been shown in the doubling rate differences of UK and Germany, 2 days vs almost a week.New vaccines against omicron are in the making and expected in April/May.If you wanna read a bit about what will happen in the long run = epidemicity i wrote a bit about it here: https://old.reddit.com/r/COVID19/comments/r4vboi/weekly_scientific_discussion_thread_november_29/hn6zdrg/The tldr would be that covid is here to stay but in lack of dangerous new variants future waves should remain lower than current ones. People would need shots annualy like against influenza, it is not yet clear when and how recommendations will change between risk groups and healthy people. NPIs would probably be implemented again in autumn but maybe only low restrictive ones like masks vs shutdowns. This is obvioulsy a political question as well but a top virologist explains the medical POV here https://old.reddit.com/r/Coronavirus/comments/tl45jm/berlin_virologist_drosten_high_corona_incidence/> With a view to the summer, Drosten also said: ?And you probably have to control the infection process with relatively mild measures. Masks in rooms are still one of the most efficient means.? However, young people who have been vaccinated three times can move freely again and, in the event of infection, also build up immunity for the community. Long Covid is much less common in vaccinated people.> In preparation for the fall, it must be ensured that effective medication is available for risk patients.> For the winter, the corona expert expects that ?very likely? more severe intervention will have to be made. The current immunity will no longer help against transmission in the fall.> Measures necessary over several years> In general, it will take years to build up community immunity like influenza, Drosten confirmed. One will therefore ?have to control the incidences for years to come with relatively mild measures in autumn and winter?. He did not explain what measures might be necessary.> Booster vaccinations in autumn with a focus on risk groups could also help contain the virus, said the researcher, who is a member of the federal government?s Corona Expert Council."
If you're goal is to never ever get sick then you're only option is to live at home and never leave or interact with anyone.If you're goal is to not get severely sick then get vaccinated and wear a mask when out. The vaccines do work.
"Research and development into treatments needs to be prioritized. The severely ill, especially unvaccinated, will need treatment."
"> Restrictions don't work, masks don't work well enough, vaccines aren't effective enough.Wrong, wrong, and wrong. We have proven that this all works. We just have to KEEP doing it and not remove restrictions/masks the second things get better. We keep doing that and pretend to be surprised when it gets bad again."
"No, it doesn?t. Everybody will get covid in some form at some point, probably numerous times in their lives. If they?re vaccinated or otherwise have some form of baseline immunity, it will be a non-event for most people. Many will likely not even know they had it, as often occurs with the flu. Certain populations who are at high risk will likely be recommended to take some additional precautions during certain times of the year (most probably won?t the further from 2020 we get), and in addition to that baseline level of immunity, antivirals and other therapeutics, which will continue to come out and progress, will be utilized to protect the vulnerable. Yearly shots along with the flu shot are nearly certain to be recommended, at least for most adults."
"Disagree. As both hospitalization and death rates are massively cut via vaccination, it should be treated as similar to the flu very soon. With maybe a slight increase in encouragement of opening some windows during flu seasons."
"Yeah and everything is 10x expensive now , no one can afford kids."
"You're right. In fact, it incentivizes its citizens NOT to have kids."
"On the contrary, the birth rate is negatively correlated with financial independence. The real problem is that there are better things to do, fertility is decreasing along with overall health, and the world is going to shit such that Americans know that for most people here there is a minimal chance that someone born today will have a better life than their parents."
Most jobs too. All perks and incentives are heavily biased towards spending all your time at the job
"Having kids has never been a financial asset (well, at least since child labour isn't a thing anymore) and it never will be. A person's reason to have kids could only come from within, as clich?-esque as that sounds."
"Maine is a great place for climate refugees who don't want to leave the US, but I wouldn't expect them to do a lot of breeding."
Combined with less immigration (which is what was keeping many states from being negative pre-pandemic) and lower birthrates during the pandemic.
"Yes, as the article says;>In that time, nearly 75 percent of all U.S. counties experienced a natural population decrease, compared with 55 percent of all counties in 2020 and 45 percent in 2019, the Census Bureau found. In Maine, Delaware, Rhode Island and New Hampshire, the natural population decrease occurred in every county.Their point is that this metric of deaths versus births has been increasing year by year. 45 -> 55 -> 75/2019 -> 2020 -> 2021. This is significant. This, of course, has to be seen in context such as the fact that the USA has the [*lowest* life expectancy of any OECD country](https://www.healthsystemtracker.org/chart-collection/u-s-life-expectancy-compare-countries/). This gap has been growing since the 1980s. Life expectancy has been basically stagnant since 2014 while that of other countries continued to grow albeit slowly. And then the pandemic hit. No developed country did as poorly as the USA. The OECD average fell by 0.5 years; the American expectancy plummeted 1.8 years, almost 4X that of other comparable countries. The pandemic came to an USA woefully unprepared for such a thing. Naturally there were more deaths, but there was also a previous stagnation when compared to other developed nations. The pandemic shone a light on a long term incapacity."
Basically the world has jumped the shark. Where is the utopia that is handling things better?
Just engage in what aboutisms until you feel good and angry again like the rest of us.
"That migration is certainly happening, as the article mentions, but is isn't significant. Young people aren't exiting 75% of the counties to migrate to 25% and breed like crazy in that 25%. A few facts can be gathered from this link [COVID-19, Declining Birth Rates and International Migration Resulted in Historically Small Population Gains](https://www.census.gov/library/stories/2021/12/us-population-grew-in-2021-slowest-rate-since-founding-of-the-nation.html) from the US Census. First of all the birth rate has been falling steadily since 2007. The death rate has been climbing since 2013. The decline of the one and the increase of the other began to accelerate in 2016, and the level of international migration plummeted drastically in that year as did the composite growth rate. The report from the census emphasizes that this is the lowest growth rate (0.1%) *ever* since the national census began in 1900. Of course demographic decline, lower to negative population growth, is a worldwide phenomenon such that most demographers predict an end to global population growth by the end of the century. The USA isn't yet in a situation of demographic decline such as Germany, Russia , Italy, Japan, Spain, Portugal and many countries in the ex-Soviet empire are. But it will be very soon, probably as early as next year. The response of various governments vary quite a bit. In some nations with traditionally high levels of emigration such as southern Europe or more recent high levels such as the ex-Soviet bloc there is little to be done. People will leave irregardless. There are some things that countries blessed with sane, rational, stable and intelligent governments *can* do. Germany and Japan are good examples. One response is to increase the number of immigrants. Germany has done this across the board. Japan is moving in that direction, but its efforts are heavily weighted towards highly educated immigrants. Both countries aim to make the task of raising a family much easier by a large system of public child care. No doubt there are other policies that don't come immediately to mind. If governments are not rational well then they will continue to hemorrhage population. They may even make the situation worse by policies that make their countries even less attractive to prospective immigrants. I'd say starting a war would be the ultimate stupidity, and we have a good example of that these days. Having a large separate police force dedicated to hunting down non-documented immigrants isn't so bright either, but it isn't on the same level as starting a war."
He?s been here every week since March 2020. He?s incredible.
You can I thought. I got j+j and went in and asked for full moderna and they gave it to me. This was in California at a Vons. I don't know if they were breaking protocol or anything but they didn't even make a deal out of it.
"Just tell them you haven't been vaccinated yet, they don't do rigorous background checks."
Yeah I thought it was insane how me who's immunocompromised was worried about how soon I can get my 3rd primary Moderna shot last summer when the FDA was busy telling those who got J&J that they don't recommend them getting a booster at all.The immunocompromised J&J recipients got royally screwed
I went to walgreens and they didn't hesitate to give me 2 Pfizer.
"Just go get them, you don?t even need an ID to get a vaccine"
"The data on J&J + one mRNA, at least for neutralizing antibody production, is really around the same level as 3 mRNA shots. It's only when you get J&J as a booster to a previous J&J shot that the data are not great."
"Got j&j in june 2021. Got a moderna booster in January 2022. Currently on day 6 quarantine with covid. Not really sick, have the bad cold experience. But it?s starting to feel its taking too long. Should have gotten a full dose instead of a booster dose i guess."
Why can't you? I got the J&J initial dose and boosted with Pfizer this weekend and no one batted an eye. Used the same card and everything.
Collect them all!
"I think you can get one for booster. Not sure if a full series is necessary, cdc might have the data available"
"Some people they are running into clunky, buggy websites from the pharmacy. Pages are not updated or not set up to give fourth vaccines. Some websites are going off of old criteria advice of pre-screener questions (Safeway was not set up for a fourth vaccine and was still asking questions from the last tier.) So then people can't go forward to book an online appointment to begin with because they get screened out or told that there's no appointments available. It's best to use a stock browser that doesn't have any add-ons and allow pop-ups, and update Java and browser etc.The Johnson & Johnson vaccine in some studies has been shown to not be effective against Omicron BA.1 and BA.2. Vaccines can be mixed and matched - if someone had the Johnson & Johnson vaccine they can get a Pfizer booster for example (for the United States anyway, the rules may be different for other countries.)"
... you can just walk into a store pharmacy and ask for pfizer shots....
Who is stopping you?
Agreed. There was recently an article on how J&J vaccine was holding up.
J&J was also generally given to a much younger population. So I?m not sure controlling for variables would make this look much better
"Yes, there is no indication that this is a statistically significant difference."
The J&J was a one shot vaccine because it's phase 1 and 2 trials showed it got a strong immune response after one shot. It may not have been as strong as the mrna shots after two but it was a lot better than the mrna shots after one. And there was a parallel phase 3 two shot trial that went on at the same time as the one shot trial (that took longer obviously). It may or may not have been a mistake to consider one dose to be fully vaccinated but it isn't correct that it was done on an unscientific basis.
"I'm sorry, but this is what's called having an opinion without necessary knowledge.By the same logic, ""Pfizer should have increased the amount of _vaccine_ per does, see Moderna has more per dose! FDA should have told them!""Sorry, but this is ridiculous."
"What that excerpt fails to address, and what has been the central fucking problem during this entire pandemic, is focusing on how your actions benefit yourself rather than how your actions affect everyone, including yourself."
Yup. Same here. Don't care what other people think.
I went maskless in the store the last week for the first time since 2020 and got a nasty head cold as a result that I'm still recovering from. I'll be wearing my mask indoors again just to lower my chances of catching another nasty head cold.
"Yeah, people's resistance to masks has destroyed the last shreds of my faith in humanity.It is SUCH a ridiculously easy thing to do, and yet so many people are so resistant to it. How is your comfort more important than someone else's life?"
You must live in Texas like me??
"Nice anecdote. I'll reply in kind. I have done everything ""wrong,"" including being in close contact with several people who tested positive, for the past two years, and also haven't been sick yet."
They might reduce drag and get better mileage if they remove the flags.
"That?s all good, but in my opinion, using US cases and deaths as a metric to determine the precautions you should take feels imprecise. The US is really big and the situation in Alabama is very different from things in New York City. I would honestly just follow local cases and metrics to determine my risk level."
"I'm right with you. I wouldn't consider going maskless indoors, in public, until the caseload/fatalities dropped to those levels and *stayed* that low (without increasing again) for two or probably more like three weeks. Even if I'm the only one masking, I don't care.. because I'd prefer not to catch OR spread Covid, and masking is the easiest way for me to minimize the chances of catching or spreading while still getting to do plenty of things I both want and need to do!"
"And there is the difference between source control, the reasoning behind collective use of non-respirator masks, and PPE intended to protect the wearer from exposure, like what is used by doctors in COVID wards ever since the beginning of the pandemic."
If only they were cheap and not super annoying to wear
"You can simplify this by refusing to patronize businesses where the employees aren?t wearing masks. If they aren?t doing such a simple and obvious thing to keep people safe, they are probably violating much less obvious things - like health codes for cooking and storing food - without caring either."
Unfortunately it?s not ?your choice alone? since you can spread it easier without a mask. That?s why I don?t go anywhere unless there?s a real need. And I don?t feel like I?m missing anything under the circumstances. The last time I had to go out (12 days ago I think) mine was the only mask in sight. People quit wearing masks where I live over a year ago
"My asthma has improved too, and I never made the possible connection until your comment. Just another reason to keep it on."
Distance doesn?t do much for aerosols that accumulate and linger for hours in an indoor space. If you upgrade your masks that will help much more. r/Masks4All has good info.
"Good news, STDs aren't airborne."
No we shouldn't avoid large crowds
"My favorite direct quote from working at a quarantine hotel, ""I'll be there in an hour or two.  I need to hit the grocery store first"""
I'm sure they'll be another wave but I think we'll see a UK and Denmark situation here in North America where no matter how high they get it or people complain the government just won't do anything and everyone will be on their own this time while it rolls through
"I have already heard people say that they expect an increase I 'flu' cases. 'Flu' cases are already up. Coincidentally, this is the end of seasonal flu season in TX but 'flu' cases are on the rise"
I care.
I don?t believe that for a minute. People care a lot when cases are high
"I don't care anymore. Rather live without restriction, even if it means I die in a month. Not even joking."
I hope you are right!
"Exactly what I thought. Everyone will be confused like ""no one could've seen this coming"""
Oh crap removing all the safe guards and cutting funding to early made another wave hit harder.  Oh well we obviously can only half ass new regulations.  Then we will remove those new half assed regulations before we are below the numbers when the new wave started.
"Yeah, cause it is totally ravaging our population right now."
"The patterns are becoming pretty clear too.  There will be a small bump in April, followed by a massive decline, and then late july/august there will be another wave."
">we will ignore the start of the surge and then act surprised when it happens. I?ve brought up the possibility of future surges affecting my workplace and wanting to be prepared to adjust if need be, to account for it, or just? be aware it *could* affect us, and my supervisor acted almost confused and like it wouldn?t be a problem, surely, even though _**that?s exactly the attitude we had this past winter**_:Despite knowing what was coming, despite me being expected to proactively avoid potential problems in _my_ role, our leadership did precisely zero to prepare and then everyone was surprised when tons of staff were out sick, events got canceled, and morale hit bottom again.I live in an area that gets severe weather regularly. We are taught to be ?weather aware.? This isn?t any different. It?s not a choice between extremes.I?m not even saying it?s going to be a problem, and we all want it to be over and done with; I?m just reeeeaaallly tired of leadership in all domains not being held to the same standard as a lower level employees ? not having proactive measures in place that can be implemented when needed to help proof against major disruptions and mass health issues. I could have used those US gov provided Covid tests back when I couldn?t book a test for days. Those didn?t go out until well after the surge had crested.Instead it?s all reactive all the time and then putting the extra burden on us. Then people quit and it?s even harder. /rant"
"My guess is that cases will trend a lot like they did last spring, when we saw a bump (but not an overwhelming surge) in cases around late-March/April due to reopening and the UK variant, but then a sustained decline during May and June. Who knows what?ll happen after that though. Fortunately, cases in places like New York are still very low compared to what they were like during the initial omicron surge. I don?t think we?ll be seeing any vertical lines"
The cold is harsh!
"At this point it's not stupidity. It willfull ignorance for the sake of ""normalcy""."
"I?m not doing anything different than I?ve been doing. I?m sad to say, I?ve stopped listening to guidance from health officials. They?ve screwed the message on this too hard for me to listen anymore. I still mask up when I?m indoors in public and I still social distance. I?ll also continue to limit activities until my under 5 is vaccinated. I knew we weren?t done after Omicron. Of course there would be another wave. We need to stop acting on predictions and actually get to the point where we actually experience some quiet that lasts for more than 2 months before we declare it?s time to go back to ?normal?.I?m still not convinced we?re at the point of this thing being in the endemic phase and not pandemic. It just doesn?t seem that enough time has passed to say that we?ve stabilized. I guess I just think we need to give this more time to see how it goes. Will hospitalizations stay down? Will time between waves increase? Will they become more localized? We don?t have any of that data yet."
"What do you suggest we do then? Masks forever? I think we are in a better position now than we were in 2020, we have treatments and vaccines readily available. I really do not know what else people want us to do. Covid is not going anywhere and surges will come and go (like omricon).I think we are in the personal responsibility phase. If you feel that strongly then continue to wear your mask, leave the others alone. At the end of the day, if you are fully vaccinated, aren't you protected anyways?"
"Every spring? No, it hasn't. In fact, last spring cases were flat then declined towards the end of spring/beginning of summer."
Yep. After 2 years remote we (fed employees) are being told it?s time to be back in the office.       There will be a 2 week window where I?ll go from not allowed in the office without explicit permission to being expected in the office.
"I'm so tired of the ""experts worry"" headlines. I mean, we're all worried. Does that make it news? Or fact?"
"*Protect yourself and your family and forget about the others*Unfortunately, I work in a service job, so that's not really an option. I'll be exposed to them anyway."
"So then are we just supposed to fear covid forever? I'm triple vaxxed. My parents are triple vaxxed. Everyone close to me is triple vaxxed. I can go get a fourth if I really wanted to right now. What is the end goal you are wanting? Unfortunately, SARS-CoV-2 is here to stay."
"You put ""normal life"" in quotes as if, what, nobody is entitled to a normal life any more?This is just a variant on ""wear a mask or you're literally killing grandma"". It ignores the fact that if people get vaccinated they are at very low risk. Including ""grandma"". At this point if people refuse to get vaccinated they are on their own. I'm not going to stop seeing my friends, family, co-workers, and classmates in person in a normal interpersonal setting because some people refuse to get vaccinated."
*If you want to stay safe protect yourself and your family and forget about the others and let them do their thing. -* spot on with this part
Yeah pretty unfortunate. Just trying to make it to the point these consequences catch up to people and they realize this isn?t going to work.
I honestly don't think it's sad people's risk acceptance got changed. That's just how life works...
"I wonder how seasonal it is. We had peaks and valleys in all different times of the year, in different areas of the world. It seemed to run on its own schedule. I think it is more driven by variant and vaccine than season."
How many waves have we had in two years? What do you think seasonal means?
Not sure why you're getting downvotes. I think people generally agree we need to be perpetually vigilant about covid mitigation efforts in order to avoid surges (which cause us to be hypervigilant during the fall out). We would have a sense of normalcy/stability/freedom if we collectively got our shit together.
Careful your going to get called nasty names for wanting to move on
"In my area (DC metro) it has been mostly normal since Memorial Day last year. Some restrictions here and there but mostly minor like wear a mask for some portion of the time that you are indoors (silly really). We've had family gatherings, dinners, overnight guests, etc. all relatively normal since last summer. The key is that everyone is vaccinated. And we simply got on with our lives. I know one person that got somewhat sick from covid and he had other serious health issues and is fine now.The media talks only about the people that get seriously ill but neglects to mention the millions of people that are doing just fine."
"I must?ve been suuuuper unlucky. I got covid in December 2020, asymptomatic, but I only went to work and the convenience store. I wore a mask, kept ample (or even 8ft) of social distance, held my breath walking by people, etc. no idea where it came from"
"On March 25, 2022, 801 people died from Covid in the U.S. (via The New York Times)  How is this not a deadly virus? These were not all immunocompromised individuals as you suggest. All types of people are still dying. Why is it so awful if people want to be compassionate towards others by using virus mitigating efforts? Aren't all lives valuable?Edited for typo."
China still has no immunity to the omicron variant. As a result they have to keep locking down cities every time they see any cases. And they have to quarantine all of the people coming into their country. Are they going to keep doing this forever?
China is about to be absolutely screwed.  They have a bad vaccine and the virus is breaking out.
Great to see such high vaccination rates amongst the South Koreans!
We did it!
come on. be reasonable. the midterm elections are coming up! political careers are on the line! /s
GOP senators refused to vote for the funding. But go ahead and blame Biden.
27 male.  Chest pain lasting about 3 weeks after the second dose of Moderna.. never got it looked at and it went away... so without a diagnosis will never know but ended up with omicron over the holidays and was sick.  pain after the shot was in the center of my chest between my pecs.
"Anecdotal of course, but my baby had it at 7 months and it was very mild. One day of fever followed by cold symptoms. Hope you all feel better soon!"
I think I?m gonna not take Russell Brand?s advice on health and safety.
Russell Brand says he's not an anti-vaxxer but from what I've seen he definitely pushes a anti-vac's narrative and a lot of the kind of misinformation that goes around and I don't know if it's for views or because he actually doesn't clearly think about everything. Think about it 75 years ago the vaccine for covid didn't exist it was created like 2 years ago. But just like all entertainment online and information online for that matter you got to take it with a grain of salt and think not only of what they're trying to say or highlight but also of other different perspectives.And I like your proactivity on quote on quote before this hits social media and makes the rounds. But this is been making the rounds for quite some time now.
">Can anyone give an objective explanation of what this might be about?Like every conspiracy theory, people are really attracted to feeling special and ""in the know"" about something that most people don't know. Feeling smarter than others is the basis of 95% of the internet! The other 5% is made up statistics. Anytime some random internet person says ""they"" don't want you to know or is ""just asking questions"" your bullshit detector should go into overdrive because it means what they're saying is 99.9999% of the time just bullshit they're using to make you feel special. Because feeling special feels good and will keep you watching and clicking."
"There are a lot of anecdotes of Omicron causing pretty severe early symptoms. It spreads more rapidly than delta in the lungs,  but it's much less able to spread to other organs in the body. Part of it may also be because it's a second exposure and the immune system reacts strongly. Paxlovid may be an option even for low risk people with symptoms that severe.  Though it does need to be started early in disease progression."
Also forgot to add I?ve had 3 vaccinations. Last one in January
"I think you should act as if you have it, isolate, wear masks etc. If its indeed an allergy you wont remember that week of distancing but if its covid you protected others from catching it from you. Take care. https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/if-you-are-sick/index.html"
"A third dose is a very good idea.  Any vaccine is fine but if you're worried about side effects,  Pfizer is a smaller dose. If you're high risk,  Moderna is a larger dose."
"I'd go for another mrna shot if i was you. The reason behind it is this> counts for twobecause in many countries it doesnt. Here in Germany our highest health committee recommends a 3 shot regime for J&J vaccinees. The 1st obviously being the J&J, then a full-mrna shot, then a mrna-booster, which for moderna comes with a lower dose.We also see that the group of J&J vaccinees shows the highest breakthrough infections compared to other vaccinees.> In December 2021, the European Medicines Agency (EMA) approved a second vaccine dose of the COVID-19 Vaccine Janssen for secondary vaccination. However, STIKO still recommends that all persons ? 18 years of age who have received a first vaccine dose of the COVID-19 Vaccine Janssen optimize their primary immunization with a second vaccine dose of an mRNA vaccine. An mRNA vaccine is also recommended for the booster vaccination at least 3 months after the 2nd dose of the basic immunization.

I?m fully vaccinated and boosted. I visit anyone and everyone that I would like and don?t ask them about their vaccination status.
Nuh uh. I don't want the guilt of wondering if I was the asymptomatic person that killed them.
"My family won?t visit them, nor host them in our house ??????? Vulnerable family and strict isolation rules at the workplace mean we don?t take chances."
"I do everything I can to avoid hanging out with unvaxxed people, not because of risk so much but because I just don't like people who are too stupid to get vaccinated and anyone who can't get vaccinated due to medical reasons would probably die if they got exposed to germs from other people in any way."
I visit my friends and family no matter who they are  and what they decided to do in regards to vaccination status
"I figure anytime you're in public then by pure statistical probability I'm surrounded by unvaccinated people anyways, so visiting someone who's unvaccinated wouldn't really make a difference. I say this though as someone who goes to packed indoor unventilated concerts and clubs unmasked.   That said, we did ban any unvaccinated people from our wedding because a) want to at least reduce the odds of getting it for the honeymoon and b) not every vaccinated person is as comfortable as we are with being in crowds and c) helps weed out relatives we didn't want to invite anyways."
"I refuse to hang out with anyone knowingly who doesn?t have any of the vaccines, unless it?s outside and I know the majority of the group is vaccinated and cases are low (had a family member who can?t get vaccinated for health reasons but she had to be there for family portraits)"
I don?t ask or care if they?re vaccinated.
I think you can be together.
"I heard with the omicron variant it's usually about 3 to 5 days but it can be as long as 10 days, while older variants are usually around a week or so."
3-3.5 days average for Omicron.  There's high variation.
"it?s not going away ~~until we make it~~It's never going away, and it will always kill people. We have to manage it now, and we have a lot more to do before it's truly manageable (wider access to tests and treatments, more research into treatments, actually behaving as though we expect another wave will come), but unfortunately, the US government is already dropping the ball on that. I understand your frustration, but we have to let go of the idea that it will ever disappear or stop killing people and work on creating more ways for people to protect themselves. Well, not us personally for that last part. Our personal responsibility as citizens is one thing, but there's not much we can do about broken government policy."
100%
How do we make it go away?
Because the article is about California
That's why a vaccine tailored to Delta would probably be more effective for booster shots.
We haven't abandoned shit yet. April 1st we drop masks. Then you're gonna see sth.
"Germany has a population of 83 million. So 300k its 0,36 %However currently proven infected are 4 million, ever 20th person. With a PCR test positivity rate over 50%, the true numbers should be way above twice that. So its a good estimate that 10%+ are currently sick or asymptomatic."
"If a country just wants to do better than the US has, they have a very good chance of that."
"Indeed. The ?leaders? are still acting like they don?t know what?s going to happen. Reactionary leadership has worked well so far where they claim they couldn?t have foreseen the carnage and then they reluctantly implement restrictions to stem the tide of hospitalizations and deaths (never mind the unknown future number that will end up with long COVID). Even the loudest critics of COVID restrictions e.g indoor masking, limiting indoor numbers, vaccine mandates etc. and proponents of living (and dying) with COVID get drowned out when hospitalizations and deaths hit a certain number.So far, this seems to be the least dangerous political approach and that?s why it will happen over and over again. Public health and pretty much everything else always comes second to politics."
"It's going to be another spring bump.  It won't amount to much, maybe a 50% increase from what we have.  Enjoy the summer because if the pattern holds sometime in late july/august we get to see the whole thing start over again and Herman Cains will start getting handed out again by people still refusing to get 3 shots in their arm."
"Yeah it's peaked in the UK and in Italy, after \~3 weeks of increase. NY is \~2 weeks in, if it peaks in 1-2 weeks it will be a good sign."
"I believe initial data showed little to no benefit from a 4th shot, so Fauci and co were recommending putting it off until there are variant-specific boosters for whatever fun flavor comes out this fall/winter.This is for people who had good responses to the first 3 shots though, immune suppressed may need 4th shots or beyond."
The FDA is meeting next month to discuss 4th doses for the general population.
when did you get boosted?
Judging by the last two years it will happen much sooner than that. It could even occur with the wave we have now entered into. But there will be more before November rolls around. It isn't just the USA. Most countries across the world are in the process of relaxing public health measures. The unspoken ! rationale is that they have decided that a certain number of daily deaths is 'acceptable'. Whether they have to turn on the red light again depends on just how virulent today's and future variants will be.
It's because COVID affects people of the lower economic class more so it's important for the staff to be masked. The famous and rich aren't as susceptible to the risks.
She also responds to average Twitter users who have questions and refuses to get dragged into mudslinging like Angie Rasmussen and Eric feigl ding
"She's continuously downplayed the severity of the ongoing pandemic situation and peddled misinformation multiple times, such as vaccines being 90% effective against blocking Omicron infection. She plays on people who need to hear something hopeful. I can't believe people still take her seriously."
"Most furries (80%+ from the latest survey) are in IT or science related fields. This one specifically is a senior scientist at the Viral Pathogenesis Laboratory in the NIH's Vaccine Research Center (or more simply, they work on covid vaccines)"
"Yeah, if you want to be a reputable source, having a fursona avatar is not the first place I'd go. If it were me, I'd have separate accounts for work and fun."
I don't think the goalposts got moved just because we got lazy. It moved because that's what happened. Variants came out which results in more breakthrough cases. Still fending off severe illness is a great goal as well.
Why is that? Any specific conflict of interest or prior examples of being wrong?
"Probably not. It would likely have some effect even with totally different beta-coronaviruses. Whether the vaccine has some affect or not by itself isn't by itself enough for optimism. If a variant still kills thousands daily. Speaking of those other beta-coronaviruses, if we were to somehow get a variant with a death rate like MERS and as transmissible as BA.2 (with immunity evasion was similar to Omicron was for those infected by previous variants) we'd be in a really bad scenario even if the 3-dose vaccine reduced the rate of death by 80% and everyone was boosted. That could potentially cause 100s of thousands of death every day at the peak. And that would still be a case of vaccines being successful. I'm not suggesting that such a doomday scenario is even remotely likely. Just using it as an extreme example to show the limits of ""well the vaccine still does something"" in judging how dangerous a variant is. Meanwhile, a super-mild variant that causes no long covid that has total vaccine escape could still be less of a burden than any variant that has become dominant."
Yeah scientists are stupid what do they know? I only trust you!!
"Whoa naw, Cobra Commander!"
"It's a strange problem. Policy is they cant do business with tobacco/arms dealers. If they changed the rule in this case, could they be accused of corruption or other legal issues?"
"According to the article, it's a 21% minority stake."
I love the edit lol
The brain fog and memory problems sound like what happens to me when my MS is being a dick.
"Sorry to hear that - it's crazy to think how many people are experiencing the same thing when the main figures being reported are deaths, hospitalization and recovery rates. Strangely enough, I didn't experience any long Covid symptoms after the first time had it, which was quite severe. However I had lingering symptoms the 2nd time I tested positive in which it kinda felt like I had a moderate hangover initially but lost most of my smell and found a lot of the food I enjoyed tasted spoiled or almost metallic taste for 6-8 weeks. It wasn't terrible after initial symptoms but the change weren't subtle. I know everyone has a different experience but to shed some light, the first time was well before vaccines and likely the OG  Covid. The second time was likely the Delta variant and after 1 vaccine (Moderna).I noticed my heart fluttered a lot too but went away after a about 1.5-2 months. I haven't had any negative experiences with the vaccine/booster or have had covid (to my knowledge) since."
"I'm in my 20s too, had Covid in Feb 2020 and I'm still having issues with my memory :( It's a little better now, but the difference is definitely noticeable."
I guess you forgot to put that last part?
What kind of memory issues are you experiencing?
"Damn, man, that's rough. My friend, she's 40, called me in tears, yesterday because of her brain fog. Her bf has a tbi & the way she forgets words, it's kind of similar to how he forgets things. She was sick for like 2.5 weeks but didn't even end up in the hospital (she was close to going, at one point)  & is still having all these issues."
Did you recover your senses and brain fog on your own or did you get the vaccines and that helped you?
Edit: *have
Can I ask you to describe your suppressed breathing? You were able to recover?
"Im the very same. Feb 20 I had it. Still left with inflamed lung tissue, brain fog, memory loss, little sense of taste. Im glad to hear the vaccines are now helping prevent it. It really is quite horrible."
"Out of curiosity, have you tried lion's mane mushroom?"
"Did you ever end up getting vaccinated?  If so, did it help out at all?"
"It's a little early to have data from omicron. We're only about 4 months out from when it first took hold and just over one month out from the peak of the US surge. Most of the people who will have gotten long covid from it aren't even at the 12-week point that a lot of researchers use as their cutoff. Even after a lot of the folks who had omicron reach that point, the data collection, analysis, and writing take a while to get even to the pre-print stage. Gonna be a bit before there are published papers, sadly."
No (which is kind of encouraging seeing Omicron has been around for 4 months now and given so many have been infected).
"Damn, that sucks. How long before your infection did you get your booster?"
"I know the chick that gives the shots at the local CVS here.Shes a hardcore antivax that makes posts alluding to her saving people from the chip every day.Im like 90% convinced the people getting long covid after being boosted were administered their vax by someone ""saving them from the Gates microchip"""
Same here. Week 10. Boosted Nov 24 infected Jan 15.
"I assume you've probably already tried a lot of remedies, but in the off chance you haven't...daily allergy pill? There's some decent studies suggesting the anti-histamine is helping to clear long covid symptoms for some."
"Same. Super mild COVID, only really a sore throat and a slight bit of congestion. But I?m now two months out and still struggling to get out of bed in the morning and make it through the day. And I?m fully vaxxed and boosted. Long COVID sucks."
Can I ask what type of symptoms you're experiencing?
"god speed. I got covid in January due to kiddo after 2 years of being pretty careful. didn't go out and do anything in this time, but kid got it.I still feel like I'm on the verge of needing to use an inhaler all of the time. fully vax'd (booster)"
"This is worrying news. When did you get boosted, and when did you get Covid?"
Sorry . That seems terrible. Twice after vaccinated or twice before vaccinated or a combination? Also are you boosted ?
Side note: I say your username at least twice a day. I have a cat named Taboo and she's very argumentative
"I?ve struggled with energy and other issues ever since getting mono in college (I?m 41 now.  I was hospitalized due to my illness). One big thing that has made my life better has been fasting and daily meditative walks or jogs in the woods.  It?s silly, but I think the old tradition of going to the country when you?re sick is legit.  I hope you?re able to find a way to get your life back."
"Aren't they treating/testing people with long covid using antihistamines?   Not sure which one, but all I remember reading is that it mentioned specific names so it's not any-will-work kind of thing   *family here just got out of covid, out of 6, 1 is showing light symptoms of long covid"
Lowers the risk but doesn't complete get ride of the risk. Hope you get better soon tho.
"Curious?  Did you have any of the risk factors recently implicated in long COVID?  (Diabetes, EBV virus, auto-antibodies, or huge viral load?). https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/study-identifies-those-most-at-risk-of-long-covid#The-4-factors-that-heighten-long-COVID-risk"
It sucks but it could?ve been even worse without the vaccine
They seriously need to create new and more powerful Covid vaccines.
My first vaccine basically gave me what seemed like long covid for a week. It sucked badly. Can't imagine living like that indefinitely. Wouldn't wish it on others.It's like you can function normally but not really.
"Same for me and most of my family/friends who have had covid.All vaccinated + booster but most of us have long covid.I have doubts about this study, I think vaccines just make your symptoms less severe, rather than reduce your chances of getting long covid."
Get new friends.
Side effects from COVID that remain long after the infection is gone.
"I appreciate that, but 'hey it could have been worse' is still kind of a bitter pill and less than sympathetic, especially from a healthcare professional."
Yeah let me chip in! Got vaxxed twice and boosted: no signs of long covid!
Sorry to hear that
"I'm double vaxed . Covid for me was relatively mild , however the after effects have been terrible. I now have an inhaler, I take cold and flu pills daily and I wake a few times a night coughing and struggling to breathe. It's only been a month since I had covid , but my god these long covid symptoms definitely have been the worst part for me . Not to mention lack of taste/smell/appetite"
at this point I don't think anyone's trying to. When they get long-covid they'll just chalk it up to something else.
Might not be related
"According to many of the other anecdotes in this thread you will probably suddenly get long Covid months after your diagnosis. Your symptoms will DEFINITELY be long Covid because there?s simply no other explanation for any ailments, including anxiety?"
how long between your booster and when you got covid?
Symptoms and stuff that last long after you've recovered
And as opposed to what?
Survive COVID and get a blood clot instead. Uhmmm based??
"The substance known as water is wet (when in liquid form), but the word water is not wet unless it is written using a liquid or has a liquid on it.And then there?s steam and ice - as substances, they may be perceived as wet if someone comes into contact with them, but that perception may be because the contact results in some transitioning to liquid form (especially with ice). But as words they follow the exact same rules as the word water, and are only wet if written using liquid or if they have liquid on them.And then there?s the matter of the word wet ? even the word wet is not necessarily wet (to feel) unless it is written with a liquid or has a liquid on it. But at the same time, the word wet is always the word wet, which could be written shorter as just ?wet is wet?. Which also works in the word sense if you say ?water is water? but is *never* true in the word sense if you say ?water is wet? unless you are speaking a language where both concepts are represented by the same word (if such a language exists - does anyone know?)"
I still wear an N95 any time I?m outside of my house or my car.Because I work in a place with hundreds of thousands of visitors per year.  They already give the staff everything from pinkeye to norovirus to every cold virus.  Couple days ago we had a coughing two year old in a stroller in our area for half an hour or so.  One parent looks at the other and says ?Did you make an appointment for her yet?  She?s had that cough and fever since Sunday.?  All unmasked of course.They dropped our mask mandate a few weeks ago.  Myself and ALL my division coworkers still mask all day every day - all of us are boosted and none have gotten covid (except one from a party).I?ll keep my mask on until covid is basically undetected in my region.  Various forms of dementia and cardiovascular issues run in my family - I?m not adding covid on top of that.
"It works, where?s the problem"
"It worked fantastically against the original strain. Evolution happens, and it can happen really fast in a virus that has so many chances to mutate because it has been able to move through billions of people. Being surprised that the vaccine is less effective against today's strain would be like your grandma expecting today's pot to be like the Iowa ditchweed of her youth."
You're on a sub called Coronavirus.
"?Why is you talking about Covid in da Covid sub I walked into, leave Brittney alone?"
I thought I was weird
Nyc cases are increasing pretty signficantly. Too early to see whether or not they will cause another surge like UK is experiencing but it?s likely.
We?ve been trending down every week.
Don't forget many have the free At Home COVID tests so cases are probably higher since those tests aren't reported.
"Those graphs are a little hard to read since you cannot actually see per day numbers. I used the CovidActNow site and its really good for looking at graphs. They Update daily. If you look at LA County, we have actually been trending down the last 2 weeks on a per 100k basis. I did notice that on the link you provided, it does state that it includes ""The case tally includes 123,148 probable cases diagnosed with an antigen test, which return results faster but may be less accurate.""https://covidactnow.org/us/california-ca/county/los_angeles_county/?s=31111950"
"Those cases are a lagging indicator.  It's probably, at this point, more insightful to follow the sewers, as that gives a more current assessment.  LA is back on a slight downtrend."
"Oh stop it already. This is what everyone was leaning on hard when omicron started, 'cases don't matter, it's MILD, only deaths and hospitalizations!!'.We then proceeded to shatter the all time pandemic hospitalization record and match the pre vaccine death peak from the previous winter."
"Case count obviously still matters. Getting infected, even mild infections, can have adverse affects."
"We have been at this for two damn years at this point, how many times must people like you be told that the deaths from covid lag cases by weeks?  If cases were declining in weeks 2 to 4 ago, and only started increasing in the last week, then deaths won't start increasing for another couple of weeks."
"unfortunately, the background of LA County's residents (including multigenerational households, blue-collar work, Hispanic diet, aversion to preventative Western medicine, limited English skills) makes them pre-disposed to risk factors for hospitalization compared to Bay area ppl. Sure, you can say at this point in the pandemic its their own fault. But then you shouldn't complain that mainstream media is trying to educate & advise these at-risk ppl to take more precautions."
Wonder why this is downvoted?  Perhaps because someone wants the government to have permanent emergency powers?
"We mandate indoor masking in my country and we had a huge wave, we had almost a million (confirmed), infections in the oficial count and we are only 3.3 million? and that?s oficial, most people had symptoms and didn?t test. I don?t know if masks made a dent in cases."
"I don?t know how I haven?t gotten it at all. Maybe I have had it and was asymptotic, there?s no way of knowing though"
"I?ve been pro mask mandate throughout this pandemic and have been happy to personally wear one, but, at this point, I agree with you. Mask mandates were beneficial during the thick of the pandemic, but they aren?t a sustainable long-term strategy. I think that anyone who is currently claiming that ?now is not the time to lift mask mandates? should provide a clear and specific exit strategy ? in other words, at what point or under which circumstances, specifically, is it time to remove mask mandates? I feel like there?s always going to be someone out there claiming that it?s too early to remove mask mandates"
"It?s not going away, and while I think people should wear masks especially in crowded areas, less and less people are going to comply as time goes on and mandates will become less and less effective, at the end of the day we can?t make people do anything, and everyone?s just tired. I think it?s good to try to stay safe while we?re still trying to create better treatments and prevention, but we need to learn to live with this because I think it?ll be something like the flu. My problem though with my opinion is immunocompromised people. I understand why people are afraid, if I were immunocompromised, I would be afraid too. I?d feel forgotten, like I didn?t matter. I wish there were a better solution for everyone but right now it?s just hard"
"Mandatory masking should be something that toggles on and off, when needed."
"Whether or not you believe it helped with the spread of covid, masks benefited us in preventing the spread of other diseases as well. People with allergies were also happy for their protection."
"If you breathe, talk, cough, sneeze, any mask is keeping most of your germs to yourself. Even a bad one. Period.If you're talking about a mask on yourself to keep germs out for your own protection, the quality and discipline of mask usage matters a lot and the benefits are situational and nuanced.People conflate these two and overlook the significant benefit of the former while endlessly analyzing and debating the latter. No, even the best masks weren't enough to eradicate covid. That sucks. But yes, any mask is a benefit to public health. Definitively."
"I agree. My relative lives in a rehab type place and they had strict masking rules that helped it not become a death palace, especially before the vaccines. The mask mandates at that place helped save lives.Studies show masks in schools also helped https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/71/wr/mm7110e1.htm to lessen cases so they didn't spread to vulnerable family. Omicron really lessened that I'm sure though.Other than cases in schools and other enclosed environments (like nursing homes) like the article talks about,  it would be almost impossible to compare because of the amount of people who never wore masks, wore them incorrectly, or wore ineffective ones making it extremely hard to have any control over the variables. I have little doubt that it probably helped, especially during the Delta wave, to try and help keep the hospital cases down, but the vaccines helped more. Once Omicron came, a lot of masks were not as effective (but better than nothing), but by then everyone knew that n95's were the best type. It's truly impossible to know how many people were saved from getting sick, but I have no doubt that mask wearing, especially adding it to other things like washing hands, keeping distance/having dividers etc helped.Edit- added link and removed parentheses"
Opposite sides of the same shitty coin
"Unfortunately I have friends like that who hate on people who don?t wear masks. I feel like they do it for woke points but I don?t know and I?m too much of a coward to stand up for them. I?ll keep wearing my mask at school to finish out the school year just because my school has a lot of people so it?s pretty crowded, but at this point, we should just respect what people decide to do. I do think though that we need to have options for immune compromised people so they don?t have to come to school physically and potentially get really sick. The problem right now is that many people want to quit wearing masks, but immune compromised people feel forgotten and like they don?t matter."
"There's almost always a sane explanation for these sort of things, just like how there's usually a good reason that people are wearing a mask by themselves in a car and they don't think that COVID is just going to appear out of nothingness.Some ideas:- They will pull it up if they're talking to someone else who is masked (especially for employees, I've heard of stores that encourage employees to do this).- They're with someone who wants them to wear a mask but not right there with them at that moment.I think it's kinda dumb as well, but it's really unlikely that they think COVID is spread entirely through chin exposure."
"I think the same thing when I see people wearing a low quality cotton mask. Either you care about the protection and wear a high quality mask, or you don't. This middle ground feels performative to me but to each their own."
"People have faces and facial expressions for a reason - communication. It isn't natural to wear a mask all the time, especially if you're not sick."
Yes I hope this spreads to other countries as well.
The article makes the point that the UK is now lumping weekend numbers in with Monday. Is this really a big problem?
"We do not track flu or most other diseases like this. For example, where I live, we count the number of kids hospitalized with flu, and we work with specific labs and healthcare providers to get the number of positive flu tests. But we don?t count every single case, and that is true for many diseases."
Had the same question. We track even non deadly diseases.
"In quebec ( Canada) we stopped testing the general population in december. They only test the medical personnel, people in hospital or nursing home. We have no ideas how many covid cases we have."
"In Spain, authorities have said they're only going to test people over 60 and other vulnerable groups. So I suppose if the rest of us get COVID, they will just not count us."
"I have got to say the amount people here in Brazil are avoiding reality is amazing: we are still on 300 deaths/35k cases on average.  Also another part of the society has been already desensitized about the war, they simply opted to change channels"
In the U.K.  we are peaking and no one knows when the BA.2 will start falling... but deaths are not going wild so everyone is optimistic here for now
">I get it, we all hate Covid-19, but the virus doesn?t care about our fatigueA lot of people, Covid-19 seems to cares about their fatigue and makes sure to turn it up."
Because some corporate bobble-heads are writing the policies.
It?s mostly because some people come in with unknown masks. They may say n95 on them but if they aren?t certified they could be worse than the surgical mask depending on where they got them. A lot of customer sites that I visited had the same requirement. You can always keep your mask on and just put their surgical mask over it.
"Surprisingly, there's some anti mask hospital workers in certain areas of the country."
"Anecdotal: a long time ago, N95s were hard to come by, so wearing one was seen as you basically taking one from a medical professional. My friend, who worked for UCLA Med, was told not to wear an N95 for this reason. The policy was written to ensure that only the medical professionals had the best masks, and wearing an N95 was like showing off."
"Honestly if it's literally possible to follow the government Healthcare regulation, it's not one of the worse Healthcare regulations we have in place."
"If you read some of the linked articles, the hospitals stated that some of the masks were not easily recognized as an official N95 mask, so they offered patients a replacement OR asked them to put the surgical mask over the mask they have on from home."
I think most are just sick of wearing N95s so they assume the patients are too. I always offer my patients a surgical mask because I just figure they?d find it way more comfortable and that?s what we all wear if it?s not a Covid patients. A few say no but most like the  the surgical mask so I keep offering them
"There?s a benefit for everyone. I guess it?s just tough to say that when there are still parts of the world who haven?t gotten the first dose. These epidemiology / vaccine folks are thinking for humankind not US/West-World specifically.That being said, their recommendations should be absolute. Not asterisk?d to protect the rest of the world. In 3 months when they tell people to boost again, the public will be confused as to why the change in recommendation."
"Worldometers is showing a 7-day average of 670, which is a bit short of ""just under"" 1000.If the FDA were to rush approval that would mean a lot more anti-vax sentiment than there already was."
But the study of a 4th dose on young healthcare workers that she cited only showed an [11%-30% efficacy against infection](https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMc2202542) compared to those with 3 doses. Not sure why she doesn't mention that part. And that will probably wane fairly quickly too as protection against infection always has waned faster than expected.So not sure what you're arguing against.
"If you are young and healthy, you don't need it. But talk to your doctor if you're on the fence, they know more than those on the internet"
"It might depend who you are. Older people who are vaccinated are facing worse outcomes than younger people who are vaccinated. Through the pandemic, you'd occasionally see comments from professors who were teaching at universities with no mask mandates. They were vaccinated but still stressed out about their environment and potential for exposure.So, here is a case where a person believes in vaccination, got their vaccines, but are living in a reality where they are facing real health risks. A lot of people would argue we just need to move on, and they should learn to live with it. I'm not sure there's a ""right"" answer, but I do have some pause with a growing general callousness we have towards others these days. The fact is, if everyone in that environment were still wearing high-quality masks even after vaccination, there would be reduced spread/chance of exposure. If it's ""worth it"" becomes subjective, though, and most people have probably already made up their minds how they feel about it. I doubt there will be much convincing from arguing online about it."
Two reasons:1. It indicates a large wave is happening again (including outside Cornell)2. You?re talking about acute risk only. Vaccines appear to to reduce but not eliminate long covid. So there may still be a high morbidity toll from this outbreak
"Couple of things:1) Vaccinated-but-not-boosted is showing *very* poor performance against Omicron&Co.2) Vaccinated-and-boosted are showing excellent protection against death and ICU but only okay-ish protection against infection with Omicron&Co. This number is also dropping fast (as per data released within the last 2 days).3) Omicron&Co are producing frighteningly low antibody response after natural infection. Meaning if you get BA.1 or BA.2 and haven't been vaccinated, having been sick gives you little to no protection against becoming sick again almost immediately. This means that any hope of herd immunity through natural infection is off the table.  Again, that's from new research published this week. It's been a big week for publication.4) High rates of infection within the campus are likely a reflection of high rates of infection *outside* the campus where the vaccination rates aren't as high and so a larger number of people will become seriously sick.5) The *kids* on campus are young enough to be unlikely to end up in the hospital but colleges/universities tend to have nearly as many employees (teachers, janitors, maintenance, services, etc) as they do students and most of those people are older which means more likely to end up in the hospital even if vaccinated.So, is it a big deal? No way to know right now. It's worrying for sure. It's something to avoid just because of the unknown risk. For any more certainty than that, you'll have to look at the hospital stats in 4-5 weeks."
"Cornell started having a spike before a big wave hit last time. I live in the area, staff commutes to work so they have a good chance to bring it with them to other communities. Students go out to other places so staff and other patrons are exposed. Not saying I blame the students for this, but I?ve been watching the county?s daily counts and it?s been increasing. Hell I?m vaccinated and boosted, wore a masks everywhere, and yet my vaccinated husband brought Covid home to share. And I got long Covid out of it that kicks my butt most days and I?m in my early 30s. Something that can cause long term medical issues to someone who caught Covid seems like it might just be a big deal."
"By ""Reddit scientists"" you mean stoners, barflys and Russian misinformation agents right?"
The friends I have that gave birth in crowded hospitals during covid got traumatized pretty bad.
Going to run into a Japan scenario with more older generations and no younger one to take care of.This is going to get interesting.
Not in the US but my wife gave birth to our first kid Early last year and it was difficult. One of the worst parts was me not being able to be there at all and where we live it's common for a 5 day hospital stay afterwards so I got to see my son for 30 minutes the night he was born (this was a kindness extended by nursing staff) and not again until he was 5 days old.
This is happening everywhere. That?s not the explanation. It?s likely tied to rising education rates
"I didn?t really have any strong opinions on having children until the past couple years but I?m going to make it clear to any future partner I?m not interested in having kids. It just seems cruel to birth kids into the world with a seemingly bleak future of possible nuclear wars, impending climate disaster, and further drifts apart in terms of political polarization. Things will have to substantially improve in order for me to be open to it."
I gotta think this is just a temporary short postponement for having kids.  People have wanted to stay away from doctor's offices and hospitals for the last couple years.  It's already evening out.  We can't even get close appointments for doctor and vet visits because so many people have recently opted back in.
"More crazy than the second half of the 20th century, when the entire world was under a constant threat of nuclear annihilation? Or before that, when over 100 million people died of 2 world wars and a global pandemic? Or before that, when political polarization in the USA resulted in a literal civil war with over a million dead? Or maybe you mean the industrial revolution, when kids worked in factories in horrible conditions 14 hours a day? No, you must means it was more sane in the middle ages, when practically everyone was malnourished and majority of children died before the age of 5.The world hasn't gotten tougher. We have gotten soft."
"The irony of this is it is only the smarter people who tend to think this way. Overpopulation is the result of less educated people just doing what comes natural. So your population is still going to increase, but it is going to be populated with far less intelligent people. People are always going to keep having babies, no one is doing the world a favor if they leave it solely up to the uneducated."
"> This world gets more insane by the weekAnd then people say the world was worse before. Lol no, just take the world back to the 80s and 90s and block it there forever. Thank you."
I agreeAt the same time I?m *super* glad I didn?t live in medieval times or earlier
Well not very many people want to live in the nearly 75% of US counties.
Home prices grew less than the growth in the s&p500 and less than the growth in construction material prices.
"Corporate home ownership is a thing.  They swoop in, buy whole developments, and rent it out."
They were already in poverty/homeless?
"Well if you die it?s not like your house just goes up for sale. You can leave it other people if you own it, which many older people do"
Not at all. COVID-19 has also acted as an immigration ban.
You have to remember though that some people wish to have kids one day because they love them and can see themselves being good parents.
Even dying is expensive.
F
Covid has a higher death rate in the US than the Spanish flu
"That was the same for the Black Death too. And even when it ended, birth rates went back up again. Birth rates have always gone up and down throughout history for various reasons. I feel like people have just been forgetting about that."
In this economy and environment!?
But most of those deaths happened people outside what was the US at the time....
When the CDC updates its guidelines.
Came here to say this too. This is just unnecessary fear mongering at this point.
"By extension, this protection from Mtb might explain some of the variation in COVID-19 severity across the globe."
There was a study that did show some protection against Covid-19 in those vaccinated against TB

"I am shocked too.  Also I think we shouldn't have any laws, because I found out rich people get away with breaking them."
"So this part is specifically talking about the T cell reaction to natural infection not vaccine response which is interesting, it says they're currently studying the T cell response to breakthrough infections I'm curious to see what the results are.  Also what is the immune response ""contraction"" and what does that mean if you get infected 2+ times before the T cells can stabilize again at six months."
"It makes no sense, as it?s not required for land entry."
"Seems like natural infection is the plan from now based on personal observation within the U.K., eu and any country next."
QANTAS required pilots to be vaccinated since November; did he get a fake certificate?

"If you don?t mind, do you have high risk factors? I was under the impression that paxlovid is extremely scarce right now and being withheld for use in only the most vulnerable of populations. If it?s expanded enough that more people can easily get it, that?s great. Could you also walk through the process of getting it in a bit more detail? Did you go through your primary care doctor? Thanks!"
"My mouth already tastes awful all the time from bad acid reflux so that would totally be worth it for me. I heard they only give it out to high risk people though so I'm probably fucked, oh well."
"I got the flu on a recent business trip. Was absolutely convinced it was Covid. Nope, the flu. Got my flu shot too, as I do every year. Just unlucky I guess? Kind of funnily like every aspect of this conference was being governed by super-strict protocols around Covid-19 (funnily because they were being so careful about Covid, but it's like everyone forgot other disease exist), and I had to attend virtually from my hotel up the street from the venue because of flu."
"Be careful, I lost my sense of taste for about a week after my symptoms subsided. It was so bizarre but fortunately it came back quickly. My case was very mild. No real fever or cough or anything, more like bad allergies (mild runny nose, needed to clear throat, minor brain fog) and a little tired for a few days. I had in early Jan so assuming omicron as well."
"All I ever hear about online are people who are vaccinated and otherwise healthy (or claim to be,) getting super bad covid but at the same time, everyone I know irl who's gotten covid after being vaccinated was totally fine, even some people I know who are very old and sick, if I were more superstitious, I would assume using reddit deals you 50 hit points of damage or something."
"I had very few side effects from mine-none after the first dose, mild chills and muscles aches and some fatigue after the second dose for about a day or so, and just some muscle aches after the third dose for about a day. Prior to getting mrna vaccines, I legit had no idea people could experience side effects to vaccines aside from allergic reactions because I never had side effects from a vaccine before in my life."
It's really no different from many immunizations.There just isn't a bunch of people whining about tetanus or shingles or... Vaccinations.
"> Could I be naturally immune?> Edit: all vaxxed and boostered, though 5 months ago.This doesnt go well together :DThe vaccines still prevent infections, not as good as against delta but its still significant. Ontop of that masks work better against omicron than against delta. Even with all of that you couldve gotten it asymptomatically and received false negatives on the tests. And despite the high infection rates not everyone gotten it yet. Several weeks ago the WHO estimated infections of about half the population. This means the rest of that will get infected in the upcoming months, relatively few in the summer and more again in autumn, also by then immunity has wane so that more previously infected get infected again.In short: you arent a superhuman and shouldnt write to Charles Xavier. Sorry."
Currently they are the same though they've been testing modified vaccines with sequences that better reflect current variants.
"No. They're all the same. If a better version came out, they'd call it something different."
"I mean, probably. You can see it starting in some places already. Hopefully it will be muted by Spring weather."
It is starting here. And we've greatly reduced testing now that the free home kits (that seldom work for BA2) are available.  It'll be an artificially-muted wave of infections.  Hospitalizations and deaths will tell the tale.
"I am no expert but I?ve followed this all pretty closely and I would be shocked if we don?t end up with annual shot recommendations for most or all adults, probably in the fall coinciding with flu shots (and eventually perhaps being one shot)."
"More and more countries recommend a 2nd booster for at-risk people. Here in Germany for healthcare personnel 6 months after 1st booster (3 months for people above 70 and immunocompromised). But STIKO apprently plans to expand that to at-risk patients as well, meaning comorbidities according to our health minister.France recommends for people above 80 and those living in elderly homes. Australia announced recommendation for people above 65, natives above 50 after 4 months.For the young healthy adult 2nd boosters arent yet recommended, but in many countries your GP can decide to administer it on an idividual basis. The adjusted omicron boosters expected in April/May may change that into a broader recommendation. Plus more data is gathered for recommendations next autumn. Its espected that for such a long time further recommendations will be announced. Its important to note that the only omicron recovered have poor protection for future variants and are strongly recommended to vaccinate."
"Most definitely.  The faster the rate of growth, the faster the rate of decline will be.  And conversely if you flatten the growth, then the decline will be extremely slow too.More technically, if the initial rate of spread is higher, then *at the point when herd immunity is passed* a lot of people will be contagious.  This is true whether the herd immunity point is 50% (R0=2) or 85% (R0=6+).  So from that point you coast much further past herd immunity, leading to a much more rapid decline.  Any susceptible-infected-recovered (SIR) model can show you exact graphs that (in the absence of partial immunity, behavior changes, or population differences) should be pretty good.> It never completely drops off and stays at that level until the next surge. Is this typical of epidemic curves?This is partially caused by heterogeneity, but largely purely coincidence.  The coincidence first: every time cases have gotten low, it's just happened to be right as things change and another variant is rising or seasonality is increasing.More technically, heterogeneity.  Urban areas have much higher initial rates of spread than rural, so (as above) they end up overshooting herd immunity more and ending up with *less* spread after the surge has passed. But in rural areas the curve is different.  The actual epidemic curve is the sum of both of those, so you can end up with a situation where cases are continually dropping in cities but running flat for a longer time in the country.  This is what we are likely to see with BA.2 over the coming months."
Low effort trolling.
Keep walking. Take a mask to pull up and down if you need. But keep moving. Otherwise it won?t be Covid that gets you. ??
"Id go with Biontech/Pfizer for the argumentation of better efficacy that you provided. Also remember to check their other vaccinations, influenza is still a good idea if they havent received their annual yet and Pneumococcus vaccine."
Older people should definitely get mRNA vaccines whenever available.
"You gotta stop worrying yourself (literally) sick over this. You already have a super low chance of reinfection and then on top of that your rapid tests are coming back negative which means there's a very low chance of infection (and an even more lower chance of being contagious even if you were infected).   Odds are if you got a PCR it would be negative, and if it's relatively cheap and you can afford it maybe it'd be worth paying for to make yourself feel better? But I'd be willing to bet you'd just end up in the same panicked state next week the next time you feel randomly tired, so it's probably not going to be a real long-term solution for you. Talk with a therapist or friend about this maybe.   You're doing the right thing to curb the spread, you're testing yourself when you feel off. That's really all anyone can actually do."
"It sounds like you are suffering from the lingering effects of your bout with covid, plus a ton of anxiety. I can totally relate; I have health and anxiety issues as well. Fortunately right now my head is in a good place so I'm doing well. But a year ago I was in a dark place where physical pain, life's harsh realities, and fear /anxiety combined to break me completely. It's been hard but I've grown a lot during the process. Again, it sounds to me as if you should address the anxiety. You're hyper aware of your body right now and you are wanting guaranteed answers. I understand that thought process: you want to be *sure.* Life isn't always that clear. I know that that's incredibly frustrating to an OCD mind, we want answers dammit! But so much surrounding our health and emotions is a mystery. I wish you well! My heart goes out to you - we're fighting the same monster, our own minds!? If you haven't started, I'd suggest a journal. It's a place where you can scream and cry. You can express ANY thought there. It's amazing what you'll write down without intending to. I'm also seeing a counselor. I can tell her anything and that means so much to me. Re-reading your comment, I may have completely missed the mark here, and if I did, I apologize. You asked some specific questions that I can't answer. I hope at least something here is helpful."
"What I don't get is why those families would choose not to vaccinate their elderly members? Even if they don't trust Sinovac, Pfizer has been available for month and months,  but still they don't take it? Hard to blame the HK government when it is individual families who willingly chose not to get the shot."
I know right?  ?????? Does this surprise anyone?
"They were not doing much. They definitely helped, but the overall percentage, considering most kids didn't even use them correctly and were cheap masks, didn't make much of a difference. We know cases will go up and down with our without masks.And we won't be masking forever.."
"And it's not only the kids. Effective masking stops chains of transmission. That protects not only the kids, but also those around then who would benefit from a little less exposure: immunocompromised, vulnerable elderly, unvaccinated under-5's, etc. Every broken chain helps, and that's what the layered approaches are designed to do. Take away the layers and the transmission risk goes up."

Did you not notice the flu disappear in 2020? It's a disease that spreads through both surfaces and air.Wash hands after going to the bathroom, before eating, and coming home at a minimum. Wipe down high touch surfaces regularly. Especially during flu season. You don't have to go crazy, but it's gross we have to keep telling people this."

"It's truly that the lower of  birthrates that are the most likely threat to humanity. But to me, all this talk of economics affecting how couples choose to have children is misguided. People in 1600 were far more poor than even the poorest people in Africa today. And they had plenty of children. I think it's just people want the lifestyle of being childless. I'm keeping a close eye on South korea to see what a childless country looks like."

"Nice, and with cases falling, kinda supports that there won't be a surge if it's already dominant."
Source for this?
"Look to see if your geographic region does wastewater testing. Mine does, and the graph is currently showing a curve upward beginning with the same steep slope omicron had in January."
"In the UK they basically have a ""poll"" of people spread around the country who do a covid test every week. Then they use those results to extrapolate how many total cases there probably are in the community."
"My family of 4 all have Covid right now. All did the home test. We're quarantined, but our numbers won't ever be reflected in any data."
I self reported and I also reported my son?s positive tests.
"Who would you report them to? I mean if I had a home test and it was positive, I?d contact my doctor for advice. But are GPs reporting cases from positive home tests?"
"Well, I'm just happy that worldwide daily deaths are the lowest they've been since March 2020 (Average of 4700 a day). I guess it's combo of enough people getting vaccinated, the virus mutating into not affecting lungs as much, and the new medications that are coming out to help people recover quicker."
Or just track percent positive.  If it's rising there's going to be case growth.
"I have a strong suspicion that weather patterns make a huge difference - the US is huge enough to have multiple climates, where the UK has cold&humid or cold&wet without pretty much anything in between (current London heatwave aside)"
"I think its likely we'll see a heafty spike in the next few weeks, like Europe has, but it won't be as bad as the Omicron surge in December/January.But I'm not an expert"
Long covid is not all good at all
What about long COVID?
"Yeah I keep checking every morning how many covid cases in the states there are, and it just keeps going down"
"The tipping point seems to be 50%. I?ve been doing some rough estimations in a spreadsheet. Basically, if it wasn?t for BA.2, cases would be falling by about 30% week over week and if we just had BA.2, cases would be increasing week over week by about 30%. The reason why cases are falling overall is because, right now, there are less BA.2 cases than other cases. Basically, the increase in BA.2 cases are more than cancelled out by the drop in other cases. But that stops being the case once there are about as many BA.2 cases as other cases. At that point, cases will stay the same and if the BA.2 cases outnumber the other cases, you would expect to see cases rise again."
"Well, it is technically the next Omicron, because it IS omicron."
The article right below this one on the sub currently says it's unwise to have your attitude. You might want to read through it. https://www.reddit.com/r/Coronavirus/comments/tkr5dl/long_covid_could_create_a_generation_affected_by/
But not everyone is vaccinated. Can't we keep taking precautions until kids have a little protection?
I am hearing and seeing literally zero of this chatter (and I?m in NYC).  What happened at the beginning of Omicron - EVERYONE was talking about it. I'm seeing little to nothing outside of Asia and parts of Europe.Care to share some examples?
"Everyone is testing at home and not reporting those positive tests. Leads to a false sense of security because the ""official"" numbers look low when they actually aren't. Had two coworkers test positive at home last week, and our numbers are VERY ""low"" here. I luckily managed to avoid it."
Anecdote
"Same here, in the past 2 days I've seen 5 people I know post about how they caught COVID.  These are all pretty careful people.  Felt the same way a few months ago during Omicron.  Seems like something is happening."
It?s all from the EU
He has been full of hopium. I hope it works out for him.

It?s already been in the US
"Omicron is ~30% less severe than Delta, and about 50% more severe than the original."
>but Fauci doesn?t expect another surgeIt?s right there in the headline.
Are you an epidemiologist?
"Well... It is a cousin, so..."
"We had the same freedoms when I was growing up, it was just that the morons back then felt outnumbered and were capable of being embarrassed into silence. Now that the internet has given them a community of dipshit solidarity we've lost a valuable safeguard. We need to figure out how to make these folks capable of shame and embarrassment again."
"I mean, you literally can fix stupid. It's called education."
"Actually there should be multiple fact checking sites, that are independent."
"Perfectly put.Not only that, but support was also reduced to the most vulnerable in our society."
There should've been greater emphasis on masking and ventilation
We should ban alcohol! Deciding for others what risk is and isn't acceptable is so hot right now.
Or it's just because of covid. living with thehigher possibility of death or long term disability as your constant companion is stressful.
"There?s been a radical increase in substance abuse deaths starting prior to covid.  Adding 10 to 15k a year hasn?t been atypical.  Sounds like they are saying adding about 18k new deaths in Covid year to the under 65 population?  And 74k Covid deaths. Totaling all substance abuse vs Covid and it?s more of a threat (assuming our level of Covid intervention, since unfettered Covid should exponentially increase Covid death rates).  I believe malignant neoplasms and unintentional injuries remain the top 2 for under 65.Covid deaths are infectious disease and substance abuse deaths are a person using substances.  We tend to activate more to help on issues entirely out of a persons control.https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/products/databriefs/db329.htmhttps://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/68/wr/mm6833a5.htm"
Gyms aren?t necessary. Exercise is but gyms aren?t.
Well Austria did learn how to stack deaths in 2020 from Sweden. But that's a different story. Btw the swedish charade is not over look at the death numbers and infections the numbers even with a time delay so not match at all. By death numbers they should have had roughly 25.000 infections per day 3-4 weeks ago. Austria again is following Sweden in is this regard ATM by test and isolation reduction. It is not applied yet but will soon....
Have you heard what?s happening in China?
"They didn?t get to the point of releasing actual numbers because they weren?t good enough to do so, they went back and added a third dose with data expected in the next month now."
They didn?t publish their results publicly
We're actively studying efficacy of BNT162b2 on 12-17 year olds at the clinical research site I work at. The protocol looks at efficacy and safety of 10 mcg vs 30 mcg dose whilst paying attention to any incidence of cardiac issues.Edit: added BNT162b2
"I think that timeline is a bit off.  The submission of data should be in 2-3 weeks.  After that, FDA has taken on average 1-2 weeks to deliberate, IIRC.  Doses would be available soon after that.  Assuming the two dose regiment is 28 days apart, that timeline is more like approval 3rd week of April and first shots in arm end of April, second shots, end of May, fully vaxxed Mid June."
I'm seeing from Instagram @dr.rishahoshino who is a pediatrician that she is expecting mid april for the first shots.
"Thank you for this. Wayyyyy later than I was hoping for the time line. Ughhhhhh.EDIT: she has posted again and estimates earlier. She is no expert, so take with a grain of salt. ?I messed up on this! I should?ve used 4w because it?s from submission rather than 6w from data???? ?? shots mid May and fully vaxxed by July 4th ?? ?????7:04 AM  Mar 23, 2022I?m sure we will see other estimates around today. Please post what you find!Estimates:@MamaWeasleyy mid May first shots, fully vaxxed 4th July@dr.rishahoshino- pediatrician she is expecting mid april for the first shots."
Sure would be nice if the vaccine approval boards moved with the urgency for this age group that they did for adults.
Why are they waiting until mid April to apply?!! How about today?!! We?ve been so long without any shots for this age group.
I mean who is MamaWeasleyy and why do we care what she thinks?
https://twitter.com/mamaweasleyy/status/1506611524609191938?s=21
My son turns 6 months in June. ?????? This is amazing.
"Damn, that's amazing. Rush emergency approval to get fully vaccinated during low spread season, have efficacy wane by peak season, push to sell more boosters to kids."
"Im confused too- one article said those percentages were for symptomatic infection, another said infection in general. Those are two very different things. Anyone know which one?"
"For two shots, it's pretty low.  Adult course now is a booster, which they indicated theyre already moving on to studying for kids too."
"These vaccines were designed for Alpha, Omicron and the newer variants are so different from the original strain that it doesn't work as well. This is why dropping all mitigation measures is idiotic."
"I think that may be against infection from Omicron. Severe illness and hospitalization continues to be far higher, thankfully. Too bad the CDC dropped mask recommendations."
"What you said is incorrect. The dose used for adults is not the same as what they've been testing on kids in different age groups. Also, no one said anything about about efficacy dropping in the adult population."
Good bot!
Good bot!
Good bot
A true bot
Right but the trial was during Omicron so preventing symptomatic illness was always going to be tough.
"But there were no hospitalizations in the placebo arm either, making its efficacy against hospitalization a whopping ""who knows""?For all the people who keep saying ""antibodies/infections don't matter"", looks like the entirety of the data on this vaccine is about those two things."
I will happily take 40 percent against symptomatic illness!! That?s a whole lot better than zero!
I will throw a shit fit if after record children hospitalizations the FDA decides this isn?t good enough and tells Moderna to come back with a 3 shot regimen.
No hospitalizations in either arm? maybe it needs more kids in the trial
"Same. This gives me hope.I'm still upset though. I feel that the US government said ""fuck you"" to toddlers and us parents with their COVID policies. They're lifting restrictions because ""everyone's vaccinated"" which isn't true."
"Fellow Houstonian, I feel like you just described my life. ?????? Best of luck. Hope we?re all able to get some relief soon."
Have you ever tried formatting a large document in Microsoft Word?
Our 4 year old will be 5 and getting it anyway by the time it's available for under 5's
"I feel that. I?ve been waiting for this for so long. I?ve mainly started doing normal things with my son at this point now that he wears a kn95, but I would love to feel less anxiety about it all."
"Everyone complains about the timeline, all while demanding a rigorous and thorough approval process.Let them do this the right way so that you actually get a good vaccine, unlike Russia and China that released vaccines which don't work."
What is the rate you're looking at and what would be considered good?I'm looking at Canada with 56% 1st dose and 37% 2 dose for the 5-11 grouphttps://health-infobase.canada.ca/covid-19/vaccination-coverage/
"The ped vax rate has been very disappointing along with boosters for adults, so as long as I get the option soon to vaccinate all members of my family I?ll just take it as what we can do. I still very much wish people would look beyond their individual thoughts and see we still NEED to all participate in this pandemic. Those who can, SHOULD. But yeah I?m still right there with you, disappointing"
"No, the titers were what they were looking at in the initial study design. They are using immunobridging: test actual efficacy in a big group of adults, then use smaller groups of kids to look for safety issues and to check whether antibody levels are the same. If anything, to base the decision on something other than titers would be moving the goalposts."
"I don?t agree with that interpretation. Two dose no-infection efficacy in adults against omicron isn?t even that high is it? (Is three dose even that high? I?m too lazy to find the data.)And even if it is to just give us parents something to get started on the sequence while they study the third dose, I?ll 100% take it."
I believe that's after 6 months. If symptomatic illness prevention decreases the same way it does for vaccinated adults over time then it will be lower than 44% after 6 months
Can't wait to see how the FDA will fuck this up.
Isn?t the 2 shot series in adults fairly ineffective at preventing omicron infection for adults as well though? As the article says the kids will need boosters just like adults.
"During omicron, that?s par for the course."
We are at zero percent protection from infection  for children under 5 right now.
Pretty much on par for 2 doses for adults vs omicron.It?s becoming very clear all of these will need to be 3 dose series at a minimum
This is such a dumb take.Kids are regularly vaccinated for dozens of viruses that are very rare in the US. How have you gotten this far in the pandemic without understanding how vaccine programs work.
Is dying the only metric to worry about?
"Are many children even getting Covid now, and of the ones that do, are many experiencing moderate to severe symptoms?"
That would leave all the immunocompromised  or other high risk kids to continue hoping for the best. We also don?t know what to expect next and it takes time to get this group vaccinated. Authorization would still allow people to judge their situation and decide if they want to wait and see more.ETA: 63% of kids 0-4 who were hospitalized during the omicron wave had no known risk factors as well https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/71/wr/mm7111e2.htm
"You?re making the mistake in believing all kids are healthy with no serious underlying health conditions that make them very vulnerable - like mine with a rare neuro auto-immune disorder. If it?s not a emergency for your kid, I?m happy for you, don?t get them vaccinated, do whatever you want - but it?s not the same for mine."
"Most parents, myself included, aren?t worried about death. I don?t know how many times I need to say this but we?re worried about the long-term effects of it."
"Can we please end the ridiculous ""low deaths means no worries for young kids"" BS. We want to prevent serious illness and long term effects, not to mention that there are kids with major health concerns that make them more vulnerable."
Could you share the link to the news that declared the Covid-19 pandemic is over?
"Pfizer went with 3mcg for its kids of this age range and really shouldn?t look at totals but more at fraction of adult dose since they?re different formulations. Pfizer 1/10th adult dose for kids under 5Moderna 1/4th adult dose for kids under 5Which is why Pfizer is delayed and had to add a 3rd dose, they went too small."
What is odd about it?  These are different companies.
There?s no reason to think the vaccine has more risk than covid.
"Claims that ""risk in children is extremely low"" always refer to hospitalization and death, but they always ignore the skeleton in the cupboard: long COVID.I haven't seen any reassuring results about long COVID in children, so I hope my country approves the vaccine ASAP and my kid will be in line for it as soon as we can.PS: I know there aren't many results about the effect of vaccines on long COVID either, but the few results there are for adults point to at least partial protection. Even if there is still significant risk of long COVID, at the very least I want to give my son as much protection as possible, and a couple of days of fever or other mild side effects seem like a low price to pay for that."
i wouldn't play around with your child's health.
Risk of death is low. But not long covid mis-c etc. I'll be getting my 6 month old and 3 year old vaccinated as soon as it's approved. No hesitation.
"They?re not. My kids are in the under 6 trial. My son had a sore arm the evening of both shots and was fine by the next day. My daughter had zero side effects. Our trial doctor said that kids? side effects are low grade fever and sore arm, but even that occurred at a much lower rate in kids than in adults getting the Moderna vaccine. I myself was nervous for them to get it, as I experienced side effects when I got vaccinated, but the kids handled it much better."
Who cares?
"At this point, there is no convincing them, so their opinion really doesn't matter.  They can't more not take it.  Their desire for freedom tubes is too strong."
That's great to know! I'd sure like to know the source of your data that there won't be any more variants of concern popping up.
"> All had their masks hanging beneath their noses or off to ?eat? for half the flight. That's what many people do; I noticed the same thing. It makes the airline mask mandate a pathetic joke. Covid does not merely stay away from people who are ""eating""."
"Fwiw a big part of that can be credited to the plane's cabin air system, and that's in favor of what the airlines are arguing for. Your KN95 wasn't carrying all the burden."
"I'm 70 and I'm starting to travel again. I have international travel planned this summer. I love my KN95 masks. They're being given away everywhere these days, and I always grab a few when I see them offered. I'll continue to wear a mask on planes and in other public indoor places. I couldn't care less if I get ""looks"". My Asian friend says, ""Now you know how it feels!"" And then we laugh and laugh."
"Yeah I took my mask off whenever I could flying, to take a sip of water, I would leave it off or under my nose for periods at a time. I was never an anti-masker pre vaccine, but now I just don?t give a shit. I don?t care what people say, they are uncomfortable and a nuisance and to me at this point the extremely minute risk to others by being loose with my mask is not worth the discomfort in a situation like flying. It?s especially annoying because you have to wear your mask for the entire airport, so if you?re there for 3-4 hours, have an 8 hour flight, and then are in the departure airport another hour or 2, you?re masked up for 13 hours. It?s a pain. Yes I understand doctors and others can do it. My wife is a teacher and I give her a lot of credit for having to be masked all day, but I?m sorry based on recent data with non-N95 masks, I?m not going to subject myself to that."
Your medal is in the mail
"Then become a flight attendant where masks aren't required.  Surely they'll have many quitting!  There will be even more adult toddlers on planes if they don't need to wear masks.  Right now some of them are actually stopped before they get on the plane or not flying to begin withThere were actually lots of adult toddlers on planes prior to Covid but most didn't make the news or have widely known crazy conspiracy theories so we wrote them off as drunk, high, mentally ill"
"It?s pretty easy to get N95s or KN95s nowadays. Plus the vaccine is available for most people. Given how shitty people are about masks, I think removing the mandate isn?t a terrible idea. If you?re still worried, you can always wear a (k)n95 and be protected still."
I understand not wanting to catch a punch but the idea that the air filtration onboard is sufficient is ridiculous
The air filtration system does nothing when you're on the ground. Perhaps a nice compromise would be to mask until in flight for 30 mins to clear things out.
"Do as I say, not as I do, please."
"To be fair, a lot of those politicians got Covid"
"All of the politicians had to be tested to be in that room. They're only comfortable doing things like that with precautions, but you plebians, you go sit on the plane for 8 hours with no testing, and also no free healthcare if you get sick."
"A room of unmasked politicians?..  who all had to undergo a PCR test before entering the room!Add a 24 hour antigen test requirement for all domestic flights, and I?ll cheerfully support a relaxation of the mask mandate."
Surely it reduces the risk to limit the window of exposure to the 10 minutes or so that people are eating compared to the whole many-hour flight?
"antimaskers can have frontier and american, maskers we will take delta and southwest"
"My son is 2.  And he?s the most vehement anti-masker I?ve ever met.  Any attempt to get him to wear one results in flailing arms and instant removal.  If the rule was masks for kids aged four or five, that might work, but now I?m afraid to take him on a plane until the rule goes away because I don?t want to risk getting kicked off and stranded somewhere.Look, I?m a physician.  I wear a mask all day and I hate it.  It?s irritating and stuffy.  I do it because it?s necessary and because it?s kept me from catching anything from my patients for two years.But for some people it?s really uncomfortable.  Not only that, but masks are not an ?all good-no bad? thing.  They are a problem for the hearing-impaired, they are generating huge amounts of waste, and often they lead to people touching their faces more.  They?re also not the miracle virus-blocker that many people think they are.  Sure, a properly-fit-tested N95 is almost 100% effective at protecting you, but those are also expensive and uncomfortable.  But surgical masks in real-world use only reduce transmission by maybe 50% and that?s an optimistic number.We have vaccines that substantially reduce the risk of adverse outcomes from infection.  If you?re especially anxious about these sequelae or you?re at very high risk/immunocompromised , you should wear a properly fit N95 mask in public.  And if you?re that frail, perhaps you should consider the wisdom of traveling at all.  But for most people who are triple-vaccinated, the risk is really low.  It?s time to do some serious analysis on the cost-benefit analysis of a permanent mask mandate."
It is hard when your flight is 12-15 hours long.
Do you wear one for 13 hours a day every work day?
How hard is it for people that want to wear a mask wear a KN95 mask? I hate wearing a mask?I want to breath fresh air.
"I have a big head and wide face so an N95 mask is really tight on my me, so much that it can fall off easily because it tugs on my ears. Unfortunately for me a tight mask also accompanies headaches. I was in so much pain when I was on a flight from Munich to Vienna which I had to put on an N95 instead of my usual reusable mask."
"Nuance is important, but the risk has not ?dwindled? - just look at Europe to see that COVID is still raging and causing mass illness and health care system load.I agree our approach needs to evolve, but it?s also not correct to say that dropping all NPIs is justified by data right now."
It?s not about science anymore - it?s entirely personal politics.
"Death isn't the only outcome.  Many of my coworkers got covid despite being vaccinated. One, previously very fit, now has a pacemaker 6 months later.  Another still has sudden onset sever insomnia.  I'm sure there's other cases I'm not aware of. I genuinely don't know why people are making suck a big fucking fuss about a minor inconvenience."
"I genuinely don?t know where your take comes from, other than an incomplete picture of the situation and misplaced optimism.Death is not the only outcome that matters. Health care system load was painful during the Omicron wave, with care being denied to vaccinated people because resources were overwhelmed.  Vaccines don?t protect everyone, and immunocompromised people have a right to safely participate in public life, too.  Staffing issues when everyone gets sick simultaneously during an outbreak affect all of us, as anyone who tried to do? anything? in January discovered.Much more importantly, we are one random mutation dice roll away from being back to square one without the protection the vaccines offer once a new variant outwits our antibodies.  The best way to avoid that is to minimize cases so there are fewer opportunities for mutation, and to limit spread from people who may experience cases so that if a new variant is created, hopefully it doesn?t catch hold in the community.?Let it burn, everyone will probably survive and it?s just a cold? is ignoring that vaccine protection is currently the only firewall sitting between us and bodies piling up in the street.  You can see that happening today in Hong Kong, where the elderly are unvaccinated.  That protection is tenuous and precious, and it?s mind boggling to me that people want to potentially squander two years of hard won gains to avoid putting a piece of paper on their face."
Are airlines really losing short term profits because of masks? I have flown twice round trip since the new year and the flights and airports were absolutely slammed.
the virus is airborne and will travel throughout the entire aircraft.
"They do...when moving. When parked, they often don't have the HVAC running to filter the air. There's a scientist/doctor on twitter that goes on with a CO2 meter and it's regularly off the charts during boarding and deplaning.Edit: found his account again: https://twitter.com/saugarmaripuri/status/1499908810428891137"
So then why don?t you wear a N95 mask and not get an illness and let the rest of us choose for ourselves.
No thanks. These restrictions were sold to us as being temporary for COVID. Flying has gotten crappy enough without adding another layer of suck
Severe peanut allergy = nut-free school and/or nut-free classroom. Perhaps these children should be required to do virtual school instead?
The price of almost everything went up because of inflation
No you?re not
?I want to wear a mask therefore everyone around me should wear one too?
Things were normal?  Businesses were closing randomly or totally empty at peak times during this month and a lot of people were sick and trying to avoid admitting it was Covid and refusing to get testedIt was actually in many ways more like living in a dystopian nightmare than spring 2020 because now we aren't supposed to talk about itIn 2020 you could say that you had Covid and we all knew it happened and your neighbors would try to help by dropping off groceries or waving through windows and there was government aid Now you aren't supposed to know even if you or your kids got exposed at work or school
Florida has.. *coughing* .. entered the chat.
">  masking won?t prevent those deaths, the key is vaccination and fast testing in the key population for therapeutics.Best we can do as America is none of those things at all."
"I get it but Covid was a blessing when it took my grandfather. He?d been on hospice care for a year and just waiting to die.He got Covid and dead a few days later. He isn?t suffering anymore and according to his beliefs, he is with wife now."
"Not all that are unvaccinated are so by choice. Do we just say we're okay with cancer patients whose immune system is shot to hell dying as just ""collateral""?"
America has decided that *profits* supercede all else in life.
Don't forget disastrous climate change!
"Regarding your first point, it's really disappointing that there are so many doctors who try and gaslight their patients about their long covid symptoms. I'm not a medical professional, but in my experience, some doctors are really reluctant to diagnose outside of their specialty EXCEPT when it comes to the possibility of it being a psychosomatic illness.Doctors that are certain that a patient's symptoms are ""not real"" and that they are suffering from anxiety are typically not psychiatrists, yet lots of them feel comfortable making that judgment call after a 5 minute sit-down with a patient. In many cases, the patient has no previous history of anxiety disorders or other related mental/emotional issues, so you would think the likeliest scenario for a previously healthy patient suddenly experiencing a myriad of concerning symptoms like debilitating fatigue or POTS would be that there is truly something amiss.An absence of evidence for a physical ailment through conventional diagnostic means is not proof of mental illness/disorder. It is simply an absence of evidence. Diagnostic tests are oftentimes not foolproof and are meant to be helpful tools for physicians -- not end-all-be-all determinations of a person's medical condition."
"I don?t know if I have CFS or long COVID (for the reasons you outlined) but man, it is not only debilitating but takes away your will to live. Plus it?s hard to explain to people that I just can?t do my job at even a fraction of my previous capability for? reasons I don?t know. My brain just won?t work. I have to lay down after being upright for a short time.I?m like a very old person when 2 months ago I was extremely healthy at 38. Going up a flight of stairs will wipe me out.At least my doctor is taking me seriously. Had blood drawn today checking for a bunch of rarer things as we try to narrow things down."
My company outsources FMLA and disability claims to UNUM.  We heard that UNUM has not approved a single case of long COVID.  It?s so sad.
"I noticed this too. Seems rather similar to Fibromyalgia as well I understand that is a sister disturbance to CFS. Doctors don?t understand any of them well but seem to be leaning toward it being autoimmune. In either case, the sad part will be many more sick people who need help and will be told nothing is wrong and shoved out the door with antidepressants."
We are about to have way more houseless people and suicides when these long covid folks cant work and get refused for disability. It's so fucked up and wrong.
"I'm in that boat for 2 years. Seen specialists, no one can give an answer as you said. Left with permeant inflamed lungs, no taste and memory issues. Plenty out there with it as well."
">  Head on over to r/medicine, where lots of doctors and nurses express skepticism that long Covid is an organic illness - the majority think patients are just anxious or suffering from psychosomatic illness.this makes me incredibly worried about the caliber of doctor in this country to be this cavaliere. They'll be eating those words in a few years as these cases build. Instead of spouting nonsense like this, they should put that energy into actually figuring out what's wrong with their patients and helping as much as they can."
"The most common symptoms of long covid are change in taste and smell. There are many studies on this, from long ago. And those symptoms are much harder to deny than ""I'm tired"" or ""my memory is bad"" which can be dismissed as a coincidence or due to age.If a doctor doesn't believe in long covid *of any kind*, then they are simply a science denier. Full stop. That said, doctors struggle to deal with anything that has no medical solution (yet). History is full of this - doctors prescribed heroin and cocaine for things that are easily treated today with modern medicine. Simply put, if modern medicine doesn't yet have a cure, there is little point in going to a doctor other than for the paperwork (ex. disability).I can see where they would be skeptical of the more debilitating problems like memory loss and fatigue, but again this is probably more an issue of lack of medical tools to diagnose and treat than actual disbelief. I've seen it before - a general practicioner disbelieving a problem that a specialist immediately diagnoses as a real problem. One of the very first things they teach you in medicine is people have an innate sense of their own bodies and to trust them - if someone says they feel like they are about to die, for example, believe them. Screw the tests and instruments. That's medicine 101."
"Somebody posted Pfizer?s COVID vaccine data here a few months ago in another post where the control group had 25% of the group reporting side effects to the vaccine compared to like 33% for the actual trial participants. Essentially, what I?m trying to say is that psychosomatic illness probably does make up a non trivial amount Long COVID sufferers. Especially when you consider how many long COVID studies rely on self reporting and some long COVID symptoms can be pretty nebulous."
"Do you have a link to concrete data showing that long COVID is definitely an organic illess, not stemming from psychosomatic or anxiety related issues?"
You've had that sustained fever for almost 3 months!? That's insane
That's terrible. I hate all of this.
"I too have long covid. I am an active and healthy 33 year old male, and I had my booster a month before exposure. It?s been 3 months since exposure. Your post is so relatable, as some days I feel perfectly normal. It?s like roulette. Other days, I get randomly fatigued, so bad that I have to lay down for hours. Other days, chest pains, breathing issues, and heart palpitations. All tests I have had run were negative.I?m taking anti-histamine but it doesn?t seem to do anything. Naproxen helps some, but even that is a not a guarantee. It?s brutal, and I just want an answer. I am so terrified of reinfection."
"My brain fog gets a little funky sometimes, and I find myself doing things out of order. If I have a list of things I need to do, I'll do part of one, move on to the other, finish up most of that one then do a third thing, swing back around to the first, etc... That's not saying anything for my taste/smell. I have maybe 60% of it back. Had Covid back in Dec. 2020."
"I'm so so sorry you're going through that. I promise it gets better, but it will probably take longer than you'd hope and it only happens when you rest a *lot*. You might look into taking antihistamines - something like Zyrtec or Claritin is harmless to take daily but helped my fatigue a lot.Don't push your limits, ask for help when you need it, and be kind to yourself - this shit is hard. Hugs from an internet stranger."
this shit scares me ngl
"Just out of curiosity...but do you know your blood type?  I know that some earlier studies indicated a relationship between Type A and long-COVID, vs. Type O seeming to yield fewer long-term cases.I'm not sure if any researchers have expanded those studies, but I've always wondered if there was any truth to that, on a meaningful scale."
"Not to mention people will get covid over and over and over, raising the total risk"
20% of americans are disabled? That seems exceptionally high. Is obesity considered a disability? What?s driving that?
"*Responding with a comment I've made previously*:This study comparing long term sequelae in people with covid vs flu shows that covid is ?only? 33% more likely to give long term symptoms than the flu.https://journals.plos.org/plosmedicine/article?id=10.1371/journal.pmed.1003773#sec016And this number may be further reduced for omicron (BA.1) if the worst long term effects were rooted in [delta?s very high fusogenicity](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-021-04266-9)it seems likely to me that the [very low fusogenicity of omicron](https://assets.researchsquare.com/files/rs-1207670/v1/b6860d3b-4bec-40e9-b4d1-cb01f64cff9e.pdf?c=1641505959) (i.e., less formation of syncytia) contributes to [lowered](https://mmrjournal.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s40779-021-00348-x) [pathogenicity](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022283621005179#b0655) and thereby lowered likelihood of long-covid. ([Syncytia formation is thought to be a major factor in lymphopenia](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41418-021-00795-y), which is a [predictor for severity](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7865511/)).[There's also reason to believe that syncytia trigger the blood coagulation cascade](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8664391/) responsible for clots that cause strokes, damage to organs (including the brain) from blood flow loss, etc. -- i.e., the most severe ways in which covid has maimed people.Finally, syncytia allow virus particles to spread directly from cell-to-cell, thereby deeply penetrating tissues and avoiding antibodies that circulate through blood vessels.Of course ""long-covid"" is an umbrella diagnosis with multiple causes, but if some of those causes are associated with lymphopenia or thrombosis (which seems probable), then it doesn't seem unreasonable to posit that reducing the risk of lymphopenia and/or thrombosis will reduce the risk of long-covid.So it may make sense to evaluate the risk of long covid and death for a viral variant according to its level of fusogenicity (i.e., looking for the [P681R](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-021-04266-9) mutation)."
Are you back to normal now?
I was on dialysis before covid and going through it during was a real eye opener. All the old people ended up dying but got replaced by the people who were unvaccinated that got covid. Just because someone survives covid doesn't mean they will be healthy and normal ever again. We even had a few women who were pregnant starting dialysis. All of it would have been preventable if they were smart enough to listen to experts and get the fucking vaccine.
"This is why I want to know if Omicron causes long covid. If it doesn't, it's less of a big deal. If it does, we should be more careful. Information is sparse on this."
"It's seemed to me lately that there's an agenda afoot to muddy the waters about long COVID, stigmatize it, and avoid focus on it.  There's certainly a motive for politicians not wanting to confront that problem, as it throws a wrench into the ""everything's fine now"" mindset and the ongoing process of businesses forcing everyone back into the office.  It also means more state and federal money has to be spent out of budgets for COVID problems."
"The LC studies were done pre-vaccination, evidence about vaccination and Long Covid is slowly trickling in and it looks quite good."
"the only thing people will say is ""yeah but this can happen with any viraul infection!"" like that somehow adds something useful to the conversation. No one is saying it can't happen with other infections. except it doesn't add anything useful, and it isn't happening with any viral infection. It's happening with this particular virus, which has infected the most people a virus has in a long, long time."
"As someone who?s had a legit claim to it for a while but never wanted to go on it? I?ve about reached the point where it might be necessary. I know there are people that need it more than me, it?s the only thing that keeps me from doing it. But sadly those people won?t/can?t ask for help or don?t know how to get help. I?m afraid we are going to see the pandemic overwhelm the system and people will scream ?see, communism doesn?t work. Everyone would just not work.? As If living off a measly 10-15k a year from the comm government is somehow gaming the system. It?s people just asking to not have the crushing weight of worrying about meeting their basic needs to survive, so they can have a fighting chance at having the energy to combat their other problems. If you think everyone has to strive to live to the standards you have achieved or seek to achieve, then you are a bad person. People deserve to just live if that?s all they want to do."
Because it?s not a real thing until it happens to them
I'd like to see any info people have as well. Also in regards to long Covid after vaccines.
Anecdotally I am fully vaxed and got omicron on Valentine?s Day and though I never spiked a fever I still have a chronic cough and runny nose that have not improved with inhaler or nasal spray. My unvaccinated toddler is in a similar boat. Wouldn?t call it ?long covid? yet but it doesn?t feel short either at this point.
I read a study saying some people who caught covid a year ago are starting to get long covid symptoms after being fine this whole time. So much we don?t know about this yet. I don?t feel safe banking my future on this yet so I?m waiting for more studies to be finalized
"I think it probably does.  In the acute phase Omicron causes the same symptoms as other variants (cough, fever, pneumonia, etc). There are some differences in how likely various symptoms are (for instance, lower chance of severe lung involvement) but these differences are not absolute--lots of people are still getting severe ARDS from Omicron, for example.So given that the acute symptoms and physiology are similar it's likely that the long-term symptoms are also similar."
"I think so, anecdotally at least I know people who've been sick since January with Covid."
Lack of data I'm sure. Omicron only detected Oct.2021 I think and most consider long covid only if symptoms persist beyond 3 months.
"I know it?s anecdotal, but I caught omicron during the winter surge and have been having long covid symptoms."
"Vaccine protection against Long COVID isn't perfect - it hovers around 50-80% reduction of risk, depending on symptom and cohort. That's not nothing, but it's not a lot, either."
"I agree with your general sentiment, but would add that long covid isn?t mild symptoms.  It?s often completely disabling."
"Hey, I have bilateral numbness too! And constant aching. It's ongoing, but luckily I have no other long covid symptoms. Nice to know I'm not the only one, though nothing about the situation in general is nice for anyone.Got MRIs and an EMG on both forearms and doctors are still puzzled, so it's already been a really expensive year for my health plan despite all the testing turning up inconclusive. But I've made slow progress over the past year, and I'm hoping to keep it that way by avoiding another infection during the current push for ""normalcy."" Best of luck to you too."
"Covid definitely can cause vision changes. There are some studies about its effect on the nerves in the eyes. It?s not the most common long Covid symptom, but it?s not uncommon."
"could be optic nerve inflammation, any optometrist/neurologist would be able to see it I think"
Yes
"That number is from infections that have already happened. Can't speak for the UK, but in the US we've entered a new stage where our covid precautions are minimal and we seem not to care about covid infections, just hospitalization and/or death. With that approach compounded over years, a small percentage of infections turning into long covid could easily become much larger than 2.4 percent of the population. Not to mention we know very little about the effect reinfection has on long covid odds and on people who already have long covid."
I'm in the US and in my 20s and I'm still having issues from Covid back in Feb 2020. And I'm not the only one in my social circle. I hate to think what my +30s is going to look like if this doesn't get better :/
Yeah! What you said!
">Investigate, indict, incarcerate the lot of them.forget it, they're above the law."
"Lol the U.S. government does nothing of substance, ever. They sure like to take false credit for fake shit though."
Surely he gave it right back as much as they hate handouts on principle.
I don't think your neighbor got that from the ARC which is what this article is about. I think he got that from one of the 2020 era Covid bills.
No it?s because congress refused controls. It?s possible to check.
Everyone's returned to their offices.
"It's significantly more contagious than BA.1, roughly doubling weekly everywhere *relatively*.  This is a problem for places that have faced it without a BA.1 surge before, such as Hong Kong, Denmark, New Zealand, South Korea, and China.  Though many of those places have a very high rate of third doses so then it's no problem.It doesn't seem to be any more severe than BA.1, though this isn't certain yet (it does make sense genetically, since there's only one mutation in the RBD).  In places that mitigated their BA.1 surge significantly (western Europe), there's a lot of susceptible people still and a large rolling BA.2 wave would be expected.  In places that let BA.1 rip, like the US and South Africa, herd immunity would have been overshot much more and there may not be a BA.2 surge at all. Immunity works strongly between the two.Going forward BA.1 is irrelevant and doomed for extinction.  Only BA.2 (and maybe eventually Delta+ or some future new strain) matter."
"There's no reason to freak out *yet*. Maybe there will be in the future, maybe not."
"Depends on where you live and how old you are.  In the US you?ll be able to re-boost soon if you?re over 50, rumor is that they will announce this next week.  I expect it?ll be the honor system at walgreens and such if you want one while younger - just say that you?re immunocompromised. Some other countries, like Israel, already offer them."
I also haven't seen mine since 2020... whenever Covid is ok here it's bad there and vice-versa. And both of them are at risk. It's been difficult.
Two years in and my brother in Samoa still hasn't been in the same city as an active case.
"The unemployment was wild. I kind of enjoyed it for a week or two. Felt like we were all coming together and sacrificing a bit. Then it just kept dragging on and on. Time and calendars lost meaning. Thank god the state UI system required me to log in every two weeks and claim my payment, that was the only thing that kept me grounded to the days of the week lol. It wasn?t all torturous; I learned to ride a motorcycle and reconciled with an ex. But I?d prefer not to go through that again in my life."
Right? I lived alone and worked from home at the beginning of this.  The isolation was borderline unbearable.  I didn't see another human being I knew for almost 6 months.  If I didn't have D&D as a way of socializing online I would have legit gone crazy
"I quit my job end of 2019, fully prepared for a several month leave after working in engineering for over 20 years. Company completely swapped in new management, who treated the employees like shit, let half our salaried workers go. Half of the remaining ones they gave you an instant ultimatum to transplant to another facility or lose your job. I got such an ""offer"". I was already burned out being a single parent, and I couldn't commute 160 mile round trip every day to the new ""opportunity"" facility. Ironically I proposed a request for WFH instead, because my job didn't need me to be in the office 90% of the time. They denied it, so I quit, and a few months later COVID hit. SMH.I have been out of work since, other than some odd pocket money things I've done since kids schooling from home, and haven't been able to get them back into school since, so also can't find any meaningful work. I'd love WFH, but finding a job isn't as easy as some people think it is, especially when you still have to manage two grade school kids during the day who are also schooling from home."
"I kept working through the early pandemic (private practice physician), so the undercurrent of dread, while still trying to make sense of the data coming in, while also keeping a strong face for my patients, really accentuated that 'you can't fail or show any weakness.'  I think I adapted by shutting down my emotions.  I'm not sure I've reconnected to them, but I've managed to keep my clinic open and my staff employed/paid and overall healthy.  The dread hasn't left.  I'm still not sure if I'm 'permitted' to feel or do normal human things.  Some of my friends were posting things about 'finding themselves' with their time off, but it was just a bunch of unknowns, and the stress of keeping a business open 24/7.  I did do a lot of abstract painting, and kept working on my sobriety (no slips, even with the terror!) but yeah it felt like a pause on life that I haven't quite restarted from.  Things won't be the same again."
I feel this. I was 8 months pregnant with my first. My income was gone. I didn?t know if I was going to give birth alone. I couldn?t see my family. I was diagnosed with gestational diabetes and foods I needed were limited. Then I got sick and couldn?t get access to testing. It was a terrifying time for me.
"I?m sorry you lost your job and it was traumatic & terrible. For a lot of people whose work went remote, it was still scary, but at least the burden of commuting was lifted. I definitely felt anxious about the whole thing, but relived I could stay home and not be around people (huge bonus for someone introverted!) I also liked that there were no more social obligations and my time felt like my own for the first time in my life. It was a weird feeling but not all bad. I also liked that there was more emphasis on nature and just being outside vs indoors and going out to spend money. It was scary and I was terrified for my elderly relatives but it wasn?t all terrible so I understand people romanticizing it."
Agree. I will never watch any of those stupid romantic comedies about lockdown. Nothing fun or cute about them at time period at all. Also got love the people who were locked down for 2 weeks and then never thought of covid again. These are the people who refer to the pandemic as spring of 2020 only and then after that went on with their lives.
"I have immense nostalgia for late 2019, pre-march 2020. Everything after that was a slow realization that the US government doesn?t care about its citizens and most citizens don?t care about each other. Two solid years of trauma for so many."
Same dude. We had a terrible bout of covid in the house in early April 2020 that put my husband in the hospital. Seeing it painted as this romantic time to reflect is just so strange.
"It's a twilight zone feeling, it feels fictional. It was such an immediate, seismic stop to the world. It changed everything for everyone and that's underselling it. I feel like we've all been through whiplash.The consequences are already huge, it's going to be increasingly insane to see the ramifications in the future looking in hindsight.While it feels more ""normalized"" now, I think the mental impact is beyond our comprehension right now. I feel like the world is very much still in shock."
Yeah with the whole wfh thing it was eye opening to see who had a nice office to work from at home and who didnt and instead worked out of a little corner in their bedroom (or studio apartment). Or who had second or third houses and retreats to work from in other towns and states
"Hi I just wanted to let you know I read what has happened to you and I?m so so sorry for what you have gone through, and are still enduring. <333"
"We washed the groceries once. I saw that YouTube video that everyone else also saw about how you should wipe down all the groceries and take the inside bags out of boxed cereal and whatnot. I enlisted my kids and we spent half an hour wiping down and separating and disinfecting.Afterward I was like, I don't care how risky it is, we're not doing this again."
"I remember long lines of people waiting for their turn to get into Walmart and Home Depot. I remember one-way aisles once you got into the stores. I remember Michigan not allowing the sale of ""non-essential"" items like plant seeds and spray paint. I remember seeing playgrounds closed off with yellow caution tape."
"I don't regret doing that, we had almost no knowledge of how it spreads or how to properly avoid it in the early days, so I think it was a fair thing to do."
Sometimes I?ll randomly come across a comment of someone still doing it and it?s like a time machine
We will never do shoes in the house again. The floors are so much cleaner when we leave them at the door. I can only imagine what we were bringing in from the city streets
"Reminds me when everyone was panicked about toilet paper and caused a shortage because everyone was caught between ""don't buy more than you need"" and ""there might not be any left for you"""
I remember clapping and cheering for the essential workers everynight. I believe essential workers deserve a holiday (or two). The amount that I needed the people (not just over the last 2 years) is a lot more than I've appreciated before.
"This is really heartening to hear! I?ve been wondering if society is moving on while healthcare workers are left fucked, and I?m glad to hear we?re in a (relatively) good spot for the moment. Hopefully omi 2.0 doesn?t mess that up."
"...and I personally have pretty much lost a large amount of faith in people in general due to the divide, general ignorance and such surrounding the pandemic."
"I feel the same, traumatized by it.  I already had no faith in humanity from the other issues I have dealt with.The political divide will always be there.  No matter what.  Just a new thing to exploit.  Same actors too.  They demonized race, they demonized sexual orientation, demonizing masks was easy."
"The minute I heard the words ""this is their new hoax"", I knew this country was going to be in for a very rough ride."
English is not your first language? This was wonderfully written! You said it quite well and it really resonated with how I felt all of too. ??
"My health situation sounds so much like yours and my reality now sounds a lot like yours. I just have lost a certain amount of hope and faith in people. I've hated myself for being sick. I've become very proud of myself for being level headed and surviving this so far. But every day of my life I feel this shift, knowing I may never get my old life back and the people who force me inside are proclaiming victory and victimhood simultaneously and it is a feeling I can't ever forget. And the worst is how many of them are family."
"Omg yes that was horrifying! Thinking back now, I wonder why that happened? We know now that people don?t just drop dead / faint like that due to Covid (right?)?"
"Same. I was in my final year at the Uni in 2020, graduated in 2021 and started by first job. It seems,that these two years have passed in a jiffy and I spent most of my time isolated and cut off from my peer group,barely meeting anyone. It's as if ? the world has rushed and I am still in a standstill. 2020,2021 and now 2022. It seems around ~ 2 years of my life has just passed away and I barely could feel it."
">I think that the advances in virology and immunology that have and will occur because of this will be amazing. Oh, and new vaccine tech that can be leveraged for other viruses as well as to deliver new treatments for hitherto untreatable conditions. Also telemedicine? Isn?t that great for uncomplicated problems?These innovations were accelerated purely because of the pandemic and will change humanity for the better, improving the lives of billions going forward. The development (and timeline) of the mRNA vaccines is arguably one of the most important medical innovations in human history."
"Yes to all of this. It also really helped me appreciate the smaller things in life. My 2020 plans included trips to Germany, Canada, and San Diego. I had to settle for a summer of exploring local parks and forests instead and it made me appreciate the area I live in so much more and realize I don?t need to take a big trip to feel like I?ve had a productive and fun summer. Also looking back I really appreciated being forced to have a very intimate and small Thanksgiving and Christmas in 2020. It made me realize the meaning of those holidays more than I had in previous years."
I love being able to preorder my groceries for delivery or pickup via an app service.
"Thanks so much for this comment. Having lost someone during COVID, and lost a lot of enjoyment and celebrations of my own, some positivity out of this is lovely."
I remember getting my first shot and it was like a party atmosphere. Everyone was cheering and celebrating. The woman next to me hugged the person who gave her the shot and it was just so so so exciting
"This is crazy because I could have written almost exactly the same thing that you so eloquently just did. I?m a teacher and any time there is a ?Friday the 13th? the kids act a little crazy, and 3/13/20 was no different. I remember after school we had a HUGE Happy Hour and basically every teacher from my school went. We all watched the news in the bar wondering if we were REALLY going to be closed for 2 weeks. Then, with the 2 weeks to flatten the curve, everything hit the fan. At that point we did NOT have remote work capabilities because I work for a title 9 school and the majority of students at my school didn?t even have internet at home. It was so incredibly isolating. What?s crazy is I was also in the first round of vaccines, a week before my birthday as well! Despite that, I had Covid before the vaccine and actually again right now, even though I?m boosted and I?m living with long Covid. Summer hit and I ALSO took a trip to Orlando, I used to work at Disney so it?s always a fun time to visit old friends for the weekend and I truly thought we were close to getting back to ?normal? Then obviously delta hit and the school year started off completely virtual for the first 6 months. That was tough. And now through strange life events I?m living in Europe and all anyone can talk about Ukraine, and it feels like Covid is disappearing from the news, but not from our lives. It?s really crazy to me how our stories are so similar and yet I don?t know you at all, Internet stranger. It brings me a little comfort knowing that another human has gone through something so similar. Here?s to hoping 2022 gets better!"
That was the day it hit the fan. The Rudy Goebert microphone day. That was the worst day.
"Yeah the NBA canceling the 2020 season was the turning point for me when shit got serious. The videos of body bags in NY came shortly later, but the NBA for me was when it became real"
"I'm so sorry for your loss. It's got to be awful to be grieving so many losses, while simultaneously being cut off from the world (another kind of loss). I really hope they find more treatments that allow you to feel you can return to the world with limited risk."
"I?ve learned that there is an expiration date on people willing to do the right thing. Given the opportunity to do the right thing, most will but only until they feel inconvenienced."
"I think it can be done, the world has shown an incredible amount of unity for Ukraine."
"I work in EMS, and ngl, I?d probably end up bitter anyway. The pandemic simply accelerated it to the point that I have the same bitterness as a 19 year vet about to retire instead of a guy with 5 years"
"Thank you for what you do and have done. I don?t blame you for feeling bitter. But I?m sure your efforts have convinced at least a few to get the vaccine when they previously wouldn?t have without your encouragement, and even if they don?t appreciate it, I know their loved ones do. So thank you."
"I'm an established private practice physician and one bitterness I have is experiencing this strange science-phobia/science distrust that was always a bit present right before the pandemic (Dr. Google and Insta-doc-moms), magnified and focused in a political way.  It's hard enough to do what we do and try to help convince our patients to make decisions to better their health, but now I feel like I'm fighting that politicization on a daily basis.  There are some quality measures that require I ask about vaccination, and I try to do what you have which is moving on, when I can, but still there are times when it's a soapbox and/or awkward friction arises.I don't know what field you're going into, but you have my well-wishes that you can find some steadiness and something grounding for yourself and optimism.  I hope for some type of shift over the next few years so that in some ways, the general populace can start to trust and believe in science again.  I always felt that one of the United States' strengths was its scientific advancements and sense of 'we're in this together' but I certainly don't feel that as much now.  This feeling of divisiveness is somewhat off-putting enough that I find myself waking up and going 'is what I'm doing worth it?  Can I keep at this for years to come?'Medicine is in such a strange place.  That being said - I still am grateful for the privilege to try to help others in what way I can, and when I feel particularly unsettled I try to step back, take some deep breaths, and reframe, trying to let go of the weird interactions and remember that I can approach each new encounter with an open mind and hope."
You can't take responsibility for your patient's choices. You give them your best advice and they will do what they want with that. It's not on you. Don't torture yourself with their ignorance and stubbornness.
NO thank you doctor! I don?t believe in putting things I don?t know in my body. Now hurry the fuck up with my heartburn medication so I can go jam processed food dyes into my fat fucking gullet.
"The ignorance doesn?t end. It might be covid issues now, but it is always something. Smoking, alcohol, drugs, obesity, medication non-compliance, or any other way that people willingly make poor health choices."
Totally understand what you?re saying but I want to add that the anti vax people I know all say their doctors don?t even mention the covid vaccine or try to push it at all which just reinforces their antivax rhetoric. I imagine it?s exhausting but I wish doctors would still at least mention how stupid it is to be unvaccinated.
"I hauled my sewing machine out of storage and made masks out of the only fabric I had on hand, which was valentine Hello Kitty fabric.My husband said they were the only masks that felt comfortable to him. He is a mail carrier and two years later he is still putting on one of his Hello Kitty masks every time he delivers mail to the nursing home on his route. I hope the residents get a kick out of it."
Bandanas tied together with hair ties lol
I was a bandana guy for a LONG time.
This definitely gave me an opportunity to reevaluate my priorities and put them in the correct order. Definitely learned to stand up for myself/my priorities more.
"Be cool if my friends decided to come back and say ""Hey man, Q was dumb, I'm really sorry I put all that over our long friendship we've had"".But nah, they're too deep into it.  They're gone."
"Yes. The pandemic actually opened my eyes to just how depressing America is. I know that people want to come here for better lives, and that we are fortunate to live in a place where we can do that too, BUT I can?t stand looking around at all the businesses- the McDonalds, the mall, even the small locally owned coffee shop. Life before COVID was just consume, consume, consume. Go to the mall, go to the store, go out to eat, buy this, buy that. That?s all we do here. We spend money. We spend our entire days looking for things to do that cost money. The pandemic has taught me to appreciate nature more and to free myself from extraneous spending."
"Mine too, for their own stupid sake. They both got Omicron and recovered, thankfully. I shudder to think what would happen if Delta got them. I still worry about my pregnant unvaxxed sister but I can?t do anything about it."
"My parents are old too, and one has health issues, so the have been my top worry too.  Hang in there!"
Same.
One good thing is that people have begun to question and reject the grind.
"Ugh this is so depressing yet true.I felt angry when I saw that the House and Senate approved this money for the Ukrainian foreign aid. Three weeks. It was with such a quickness!Meanwhile? we had to grovel for weeks and weeks for aid from the government during a pandemic. Don?t get me wrong, I?m pro Ukraine, but holy shit. Our elected officials don?t care about us as people. We?re just pawns I guess."
"You need therapy, friend. Things aren?t nearly as bad."
"A hermit here. I don't worry about getting sick for my own health. I worry about having to close my business for two weeks and putting 10 other people on two weeks unpaid vacation. Still haven't caught it. And yeah, any asshole who hasn't gotten a shot, they're nuts and I don't need them in my life. I'm grateful they're so happy to advertise their choice."
"This, right here. I'm vaccinated, boosted, and I had it. I can't make the tons of people that refuse vaccination get vaccinated. I can't force people to wear a mask. I do what I can and I worry about myself. It's taken a lot of anger and anxiety off."
"on behalf of the unvaccinated, I promise you they don't give a single fuck if you welcome them in your life lol"
"that sounds awful, are you proud of living like a prisoner?"
"We need a new word that is like jaded but, more."
"Kind of like how they?re saying ?see, it?s no worse than flu!? Yeah NOW, after all those people died with Alpha or Delta and millions of vaccines were given and everyone else got the milder variant. You were not right all along and you are DAMN LUCKY you didn?t die when you took horse meds for your COVID. And you don?t know what effects COVID can have later on so?good luck I guess.Talking specifically to my parents now, here. ??"
Agreed.
Good on you for taking care of the vulnerable. Wish society would learn how to do that better.
"I remember hearing about it after Christmas and thinking ?ehhh, this doesnt sound great?? and then two months later word started trickling in more."
"I'm doing a report on the early days of the pandemic and these links are definitely gonna come in handy. Thanks, friend!"
"There is plentiful evidence that it does. And many other cardiovascular issues, including strokes and kidney damage. And things like autoimmune diabetes. Pick an organ, Covid can probably ruin it in the unlucky. And since it's going to keep mutating, everyone is going to get many chances to get unlucky."
Someone yelled at you for being vaccinated? I?m vaccinated and haven?t been yelled at. I see a lot of people yelling at unvaccinated though
"Might be informative for immunocompromised but sounds like watching paint dry for healthy, especially vaccinated, people"
"especially the beyond idiotic 24 hour before flight one, which is almost impossible to get in many countries."
"Agreed, particularly given that many other countries (at least in Europe) have dropped testing requirements. Seems kind of dumb to not have any requirements to visit another country, but then have to scramble to get a test right before my flight home even though I'm vaccinated."
Right? This seems like the most logical thing to drop as it's far more time-intensive and a true exercise in hygiene theater. At least wearing a mask has an actual chance at doing something. The other is just a profit generator for some private lab. Oh wait....
Agreed. I just did this and they didn't even check it. They announced they would randomly select passengers to check. We were in a group of 20 and no one was selected. Seems like its not really a requirement as it is based on that anyway...
It?s ridiculous that this is still a thing. Canada is even dropping it on Friday. Crickets from the US.
"Seriously.  I'm on vacation in Rome, where they have zero testing requirements (they never even asked to see our locator forms). We came here, and are returning to, London -  with zero testing requirements. The only place I have to test is to return to my own country. It's a few weeks away, so we're hoping it'll end before our trip.And we're anxiously watching the news. With our luck the requirement will end days after we return. But one test is better than the 4 we would have had to purchase."
"Would love this so much, traveled last year with my 2 year old and testing him was straight up traumatic. At least drop the requirement for little kids, or keep it for just unvaccinated adults or something!"
waiting for this to drop! I don't want to test positive and be stuck
por que no los dos
"I think I?m masking on flights from here on out to be honest. I?ve still got like 40 N95s left in my box, and I used to get sick to some degree every other time I flew. I had one particularly bad trip years back where I spent almost my whole stay in CA sick with the flu. If I?m taking time off and paying for the trip, and I?ve already got the masks anyway, why not safeguard my investment?"
"Well with your bad knee, Ed, you shouldn't throw anybody."
"I think most places are moving to one-way masking. I think masking mandates should be a dimmer switch, not some permanent on/off switch. A good N95 mask in an airplane is certainly sufficient. Especially once airborne. The problem is that if we get another massive surge in cases, it would be too difficult to get people to re-mask again. Which is very unfortunate because it?s that very phenomenon that makes it difficult to have policies that reduce public safety mandates."
As long as it?s optional.
"May I ask why?  My aim is not to be confrontational, judgemental, or rude.  Serious question here.  I thought the purpose of the mask was to protect others from the mask wearer's germs; not the other way around.  Or do I have that wrong?  Assuming i do not have it wrong, what is the point of being the (potentially) sole person wearing a mask in a crowded situation?"
It's a great way to cover a cold sore
"Just like driving, can't let your guard down."
"Also, being stuck in Hawaii, Mexico, or other place for an unexpected 10 extra days can make for an expensive vacation."
"> Are you about to get back on the plane and infect everyone?A lot of people seem to have no issue with doing this, unfortunately."
"Covid is already rampant wherever you are and wherever you?re going. Air on planes is continuously filtered and refreshed, much more so than air in the local grocery store. Mask mandates on planes do nothing but make an already stressful situation even worse. Wear them if you want, but don?t force masks on anyone else."
What about the asshole sitting next to you coughing and sneezing into your airspace and you can?t move away?  I personally know people who do that and I stay far away from them even outside on a windy day.
Especially planes.. hmm well planes are better than other indoor locations as they have hepa filters and they recycle the air 30 to 50 times more than an office space.
Not even. If it keeps me from getting the flu or a cold then hell yeah. Worth it. Even if it's just once a year benefitting me
"so wear it, nobody has a problem with that. but were at the point now where it should no longer be mandatory"
I might also wear a mask in certain situations. Still I think masking should be a personal choice when health care impact from the virus is under control.
"Please go right ahead.  Please allow those of us who are less risk-averse (I?m vaxxed/boosted) to make our own choices, as well.There are also situations where I may wish to wear a mask."
"Unless they made a new announcement, the CDC still has the mask mandates for public transit modes (including planes) set to expire 4/18."
"It?s almost all political now.  Which is the new ?following the science?, sadly."
"There's ""the science,"" then there's ""what do we do with the science?""  For example, we know that COVID transmits through the air and is a respiratory disease.  That's science.  How to best deal with that on a mass basis isn't quite ""science.""  Could we put every person into a bubble in their homes and lock them down for a full year without any human interaction?  And would that be ""science?""  I mean, that would solve it but is that the way we should do it?"
The risk of infection is lower on planes than many other places we frequent on a daily basis like malls and grocery stores.
"I mean, the science says getting sick is bad, so leave your house as infrequently as possible, and wear a mask when you do for the rest of your life.Obviously, that is not a reasonable or sustainable ask for the vast majority of people."
"Science is ""how does this work""?Policy/politics is ""what do we do with this information?""Follow the science is ""let's align our policy with scientific recommendations"".Ultimately what we do depends heavily on tradeoffs. We are balancing many things, only one of which is the scientific area of disease transmission vectors and rate."
its been this way from week 1 man.  people have been sick of it before we even got vaccines.  crazy times.
Governments just gave up on getting more than 90% of the population vaccinated. Misinformation is rampant and you won't be able to convince the people scared of needles to get the jab anymore.
"The plan for mitigation tactics like social distancing and masks has always been the same regardless of the respiratory virus in question. it's just that people became more aware of these mitigation tactics as they were being enforced instead of suggested. That being said, we use these mitigation tactics when know infection rates are at certain threshold. They've been below that threshold for a while now. That doesn't mean it won't spike again (which it will do again with or without lifting mandates). The plan is always reactionary to reducing the current wave's impact after it arrives. Another wave is on the way, but it seems to be getting people that aren't vaccinated and/or didn't get this last wave, so it remains to be seen if/when mitigation tactics will be mandatory again."
Time to go back to normal. No one is stopping you from wearing a mask. But science supports airplane ventilation to already make them a very low risk place to be maskless.
"Meh. There are a few flight attendants that love the new power. Not a huge amount, but as a frequent flyer there are a few that relish the power."
"Vaccine passports aren't really a great indicator of anything at this point.  I got my booster last Nov, meaning it's basically worthless now.  All the music/sporting venues around me stopped requiring proof of vaccine in the last couple of weeks.  With weaker and weaker variants, I'm honestly unlikely to even get another booster at this point.  Seems kind of pointless as a young, healthy person.  I plan on continuing to mask on planes though... I used to get sick every time I fly and that hasn't happened in the last 2 years, which is pretty nice."
"We should have been doing this for the past year, with or without masks. Biden admin should have waited until like 4 weeks before Thanksgiving 2021 and announced that anyone flying, taking a train, or taking a bus after November 20th is required to have at least one dose. We could have scooped up a few million people just like that."
"Vaccine mandates for entry/ticketing accomplish nothing. Unless you're *recently* boosted, you have negligible to zero protection against being infected (and thus being contagious)."
At least everything doesn't give you acne
Except for that guy a road over from me. He died from COVID Sunday. But that?s too inconvenient for your activities
"you need to read some literature, my friend. I don't have the energy to argue with you about how the immune system works, go through the data about the outrageous efficacy of personal protection granted by the N95. I'm also not 100% sure you're not trolling, this comment is so off-base."
"I don?t mind you wearing a mask at all. Just when the mandates are dropped, don?t blame people for taking a choice and not wearing masks. FFP2 and similar masks should continue to be advised for those that wants to avoid Covid - I?m currently also wearing one if I have something important coming up."
">There is zero downside to mandating masks on planes FOREVER.I'm all for keeping the mandate because I believe the benefit outweighs the cost, but let's not pretend like there is no cost. Masks are uncomfortable. They make communicating difficult, they make eating and drinking difficult, and though not to a level to cause health concerns, they make breathing difficult. We don't need to lie about this reality to decide they're still worth wearing."
"Getting sick ones in a while won't automatically kill you, you know ? If you want to wear a mask forever, it is your personal choice. Please don't try to force anyone who has and wants to keep an functioning immune system to wear one just because you are scared of getting sick at all."
Guess you work for spirit ? Would explain why your so determined to make flying as miserable as possible
I think the lead in your water is getting to you
This is silly. On a plane you can eat and drink (obviously without a mask) and who knows what people do in the bathrooms. Many hang their noses out and the flight attendants can only do rounds so often to correct. A test beforehand to make sure passengers are well makes MUCH more sense.
"I think you have it backwards - once the political stigma of not treating masks as if they're magical has worn off, I think people will see they were over-used. (And just for context, I will probably be continuing to wear a mask on a plane indefinitely, ESPECIALLY if I hear so much as a sniffle from someone within a few rows)."
Like Hong Kong? China?
Really adding some great stuff to the discourse with this.
The biggest action that could be taken is vaccination which I?m guessing most of these 700 per day didn?t do.
What action do you propose?
Is the excess death in the US still above normal levels?I think that's the only question to be answered at this point.
So you have to grow your own broccoli? Or is that something you can find at the store?
"How about microgreens of broccoli, would that be a similar concentration?"
broccoli's good.
"Well, maybe try preparing it a different way.  Sometimes our caregivers prepare foods in ways which they enjoy (or tolerate) but really ruin it for others.  If it's been a while, keep in mind as you age your taste preferences will shift.   Lesser known benefit, when you endorse and support broccoli you can become a member of Big Broccoli Conglomerates (BBC) and use that in your professional and social profiles."
Should try ?crack broccoli? aka broccoli roasted with olive oil and a bit of sugar lol
Sulforaphane is also present in Moringa powder. I add a bunch to a smoothie and it?s super easy to get down.
"Broccoli FTW!There's an even higher concentration of sulfarophane in the peppery delight known as broccoli sprouts.Sulfarophane may also slow certain cancers. I'm not current on the science there, but it's good stuff."
"Like most things kids don?t like, it?s probably because the older generation served veggies soggy/from a can. Broccoli can be incredibly inexpensive if you buy the fresh heads, and you just toss it with olive oil and seasoning (harissa is my favorite) and put in the oven for 20 minutes at 400. It also lasts a while in the fridge (it became a staple of fresh produce in our house when we only wanted to shop once every 2 weeks during Covid)."
<3 you too
> UNLESS you chop your broccoli*[Dana Carvey has entered the chat]*
Or just eat it raw. Dip it in veggie dip or ranch. Broccoli is wonderful raw.
"So frozen broccoli, already being chopped, wouldn't have this enzyme? That's a pity, I usually buy it frozen and in small pieces. Good for throwing into things I have to cook quickly."
You can also just add mustard powder and that activates creation of sulforaphane in broccoli that hasn?t been ?chopped and held? or frozen. https://nutritionfacts.org/video/second-strategy-to-cooking-broccoli/
I think you can also use mustard power to activate it. At least that?s what Dr Greger says.
Some stores sell pre-chopped broccoli florets.
"Also: ""I always knew broccoli was full of microchips!"""
sometimes the body just knows
This is the real reason mice will take over as the dominant species We are committing atrocities against them but learning how to give them excellent health and make them smarter while we do it
"I plan on telling anti-vax morons that the broccoli study was paid for by Pfizer so they won?t trust it, it?ll leave all the broccoli for us and they can stick to drinking their own piss, or whatever they do."
OR?this is as win-win as it gets.
"Vaccines for children came out after covid apathy built up more, community immunity had built up more, and children are at much lower risk for severe outcomes from covid than their parents (especially if they were already infected before vaccines were available). Its to be expected that children vaccination rates are much lower. People have been predicting this since before 5-11 year olds could get vaccines (You can find some examples in the reddit thread posted by u/maxkozlov 5 months ago with the article ""What COVID vaccines for young kids could mean for the pandemic""). Maybe its a bit surprising that its only 30% in LA of all places. But its certainly within expectations."
"Children are at astronomically low risk, and fda approved vaccines for young children had something along the lines of 11% efficacy with delta I believe, presumably lower with omicron. All this is off the top of my head and relatively old, but the data is available nonetheless."
"Anecdotally, parents are weary of a ?new vaccine? without real world data for their kids. Paired with the ?low risk? of COVID in kids. The side effects of the vaccine also sucked for adults and I think that?s scared off parents. Many are waiting. I?m not saying I agree (as long as there is ample safety data I wil get my kid vaccinated? of course I?ll have the privilege of waiting by default since I?m still pregnant)"
Because they are afraid of something that they can?t describe.
"This is incredibly sad. As Dr. Feigl-Ding and Dr. Topol have predicted, we are about to see an unnecessary wave of BA2 infections in schools. One can only hope that children will not develop long COVID at the same rate as adults."
"The vaccine disinformation already convinced a person to refuse the rabies vaccine after they were bitten by a wild animal.  They became the first rabies death in decades.  And recently a member of Congress stated, ""I don't see the CDC recommending a second polio shot"".  FYI, the CDC recommends a series of 4 polio vaccine shots."
"I'm already seeing it in my community. I have a few pregnant friends that are starting to question even the childhood vaccines. Candace Owens is doing a big podcast right now putting a lot of mistrust into the vitamin K shot and supposedly she will be working through all the childhood vaccines. She's doing it ""to help parents ask questions and feel informed."" Which is fine, people should ask questions. People should feel informed, but I get scared at the amount of people who will just take Candace Owens word at face value. Or parents who end up with doctors that dismiss their concerns or berate them. It will only cause people to dig their heels in more. I'm nervous for the next few generations."
"When we got our kid's normal vaccines years ago our doctor was visibly relieved that she didn't have to have a lengthy conversation to convince us to do it. The anti-vaxx idiocy has been rampant for decades, and even people who think they're not susceptible to it have heard it so often that they're now hesitant to get their kids involved. It's a tragedy.Schools should make the vaccine mandatory for attendance, just like the MMR shots. If there's one thing this pandemic has taught me, it's that people can't be trusted to make the right decision when it comes to community health."
"We just got covid and while we all were vaccinated our 3.5 year old obviously wasn't and the covid was harshest for her.I'm upset that the restrictions were lifted before vaccines are available to everyone.Also if you managed to not get covid yet and are wearing surgical masks. Stop, it's a waste of time. Now that people don't wear masks they don't protect anymore, you need to use N95 or equivalent.I was wearing surgical mask and still got infected while waiting in line in a pharmacy. Fuck those people and management."
Oh but it will. Ugh.
"This is a direct result of the overpromises made about the vaccine. The powers that be were unable or unwilling to honestly and accurately discuss the vaccine and as a result have lost public trust on the subject. ""If you take the vaccine, you won't get infected.""""How about making sure that you?re vaccinated, so you do not spread the disease to anyone else."""
Governments and corporations became too untrustworthy.
"As a father in Canada, the hesitation is largely due to the fact that the efficacy of the current vaccines doesn't seem to be that great in young children:https://www.nytimes.com/2022/02/28/health/pfizer-vaccine-kids.htmlOn top of that, other diseases appear to be much worse in children, at least in Canada. Other diseases:https://www150.statcan.gc.ca/t1/tbl1/en/tv.action?pid=1310039201&pickMembers%5B0%5D=2.4&pickMembers%5B1%5D=3.1&cubeTimeFrame.startYear=2016&cubeTimeFrame.endYear=2020&referencePeriods=20160101%2C20200101Here you can see COVID in <5, it really hasn't been a problem:https://health-infobase.canada.ca/covid-19/epidemiological-summary-covid-19-cases.htmlNow I understand the argument about long COVID, but again almost every viral infection has this chance, so that's not new and given the low efficacy of the vaccines, unavoidable:https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC387426/https://academic.oup.com/cid/article/58/6/775/342770The only solution I have for my kids is to wear masks and avoid risky behaviors. I don't think the vaccine helps them, but I'm open to debating this."
"We have a large subsection of a major political party who thinks Tom Hanks eats babies.I think the damage from the whole lead-in-water, lead-in-paint is coming to fruition."
Hard times make strong people. Easy times make soft people. Or something like that
>How did we get so fucking stupid.[Vaccine rates lag among young blacks and Latinos in LA County]([https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2021-09-18/vaccine-rates-lag-younger-black-latino-los-angeles-countyVaccine)
Facebook and infotainment ?news?
I will vaccinate my children when there is science showing that kids get a measurable health benefit from vaccination after infection.
Same reason everyone should get the shot. Reduce the risk of long Covid and potentially saving yourself a couple thousand bucks on a trip to the ER.
"To ensure they are best equipped to fight the virus when they encounter it by training their immune system to deal with it.No different than adults.Lower risk in youth, yes, but not non-zero... Closer to zero with vaccination.I can't fathom why a responsible parent would want anything but the lowest risk possible for their child.  Protection of one's child is a parent's most urgent responsibility."
lol this can't be a serious question
And yet so damn wrong. Kids deserve better than risking long COVID and other not-yet-known health issues from contracting COVID-19.
"That blows. Maybe you really want to go visit a relative in another state or even a friend that now lives in San Francisco, where those 12+ can provide vax consent.I hope your folks at least let you wear N95 masks."
"I'm so sorry you're stuck in that situation. I hope your parents come around, or you find a way to get the vaccine."
What measures remain in schools ?
very funny! very creative!
"Nobody cares about the amount of infections. As long as ICUs aren?t full and health care isn?t in danger there?s no legitimate reason for restrictions. Everyone could get the vaccine, so it?s the only right call to scrap the restrictions now"
"So scrapping restrictions means the peak will come faster. Look at the US, only 2% positivity rate with almost one million tests per day taken."
"With all the technology that we have today, it's really too bad that intranasal vaccines (in general) weren't already further along."
No kid uses Facebook. Old folks on the other hand...
It was made exponentially worse.
"The last paragraph of the article addresses this point:""That?s why it?s dangerous to allow the children?s mental health conversation to get stuck in the toxic loop of pandemic politics. The acute traumas of the covid era will end, and with them some of American families? situational distress. But the children?s mental health crisis won?t. If we don?t open our minds to its totality, then all the new and ramped-up attention from the past two painful years will end up little more than ?mealy mouthed statements ? like the ?thoughts and prayers? after a school shooting,? as Peter Jensen put it. That is to say: just talk."""
"The early 2010s is when social media ratcheted up its effect on kids, and anxiety, depression & self-harm increased at the same time among teens.  Psychologist Jonathan Haidt has great talks on this on youtube: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pFl5r2h9pm0"
"> Gender identity issuesAre you saying that the freedom (and responsibility?) to choose one's gender is on average causing more stress and mental health issues than it is solving?Edit: downvotes, but no replies. The OP does seem to be saying ""gender identity issues"" are a new thing which is linked to mental illness. I found that surprising so I asked for clarification."
This is heartbreaking. I honestly feel that social media teaches people and now children that their value comes from what others think of them. If they somehow don't fit society's expectations then they are somehow not good enough.. it can't be good for anyone to second guess their value.
"My kid has dyslexia and autism, her issues started way before she was allowed a phone/computer and she is still not allowed to use social media. There are more and more kids presenting with problems at very young ages, talking 4, 5 and 6. Some of it is related to the pandemic, I think there is a deeper problem here than just phones and social media. A few things - since the 2007 recessions a lot of funding (at least in the UK) has been removed from social services and local councils that offered services for parents and young pre-school age children. Social services no longer have the budget for early intervention, they only the resources for the worst cases. By which time it can be too late for the child and in most cases are having to be removed from the family causing further issues. These in the past could have been prevented or lessened with earlier interventions in the past.Parents do not let their children outside as much as they used to. These days its quite common for children up to the age of secondary school never being allowed out of their houses on their own. Parents are too fearful of abductions and accidents. This stifles any introduction to independence and keeps the children in only safe secure zones at home where they have everything and there is no actual conflict or real world problems. Schools are more attuned to children with mental and behavioral issues. Kids would be labeled as stupid and put on remedial studies or just shipped off to special schools. These days these kids are identified and targeted with specialist help from schools, with them trying in the upmost to keep them in mainstream schools. So naturally everyone becomes more aware that there ar eissue sinstead of trying to bury it.The flipside of schools targeting children with special needs and keeping them in mainstream schools is that budgets for schools have not increased in line with these extra resources needed, so schools end up having to do more with less which can be too much for the school and teachers, where they can't deal with the issues properly. Obviously covid is a factor, most teacher and and teaching assistants have seen an uptick of issues since the lockdowns, especially in early years where children missed out on the first year to 18 months of school education, this is mainly anecdotal though and studies are still ongoing. Of course phones and social media will also have an impact, not just directly (although some studies have shown that screen time isn't that bad), but indirectly when parents themselves are consumed with their screens they ignore the child and the child develops other means to gain attention and think that its normal.The main take is that these issues are presenting earlier than when children start using social media, which of course can exacerbate issues when children start reaching their teens."
"The trends in child mental health precede social media, cell phones and even the internet. From the article:""The most worrisome and dramatic effects were occurring among the many, many children ? 1 in 5 is the proportion that has commonly been cited for the past two decades ? who already had diagnosable mental disorders. This is not surprising. Mental health experts know that conditions like severe depression don?t pop up out of nowhere. They may seem to ? particularly to parents when they?re first becoming aware of the signs in their kids ? but there are pretty much always antecedents. At Children?s National, it can take days, and careful teamwork by experts and their trainees, to find and understand them. But at the recent morning?s rounds, the antecedents were starkly on display: histories of depression, anxiety, trauma, self-harm.""My wife is an aid in a small country school, and she says the rate they see this year is closer to 1 in 3. The roots of the problem go much deeper than what kids do on their computing devices."
"Twitch/livestreams has its own issues, parasocial relationships, and trying to stand out by giving big donos or trolling to get big streamers attention.Thats why i only stick to smaller streamers. The communities there are more chill and feel more connected since you see familiar names everytime.Try going to Tyler1 or Mizkif stream and its a chat shitstorm."
"You?re talking about college age kids in honors classes. I think this is more aimed to grade school kids. The 8 year old who spends 6 hours a day on Facebook/Instagram/tiktok kind of deal. Those kids are fucked. I?ve met some stupid little kids and I know they?re stupid because the parents let them be on their phones all day. It?s brain rot. When 70% of the information you take in on a daily basis is big loud, targeted media how are you supposed to develop any kind of critical thinking or communication skills?"
"It really is heartbreaking.  They?re not just growing up like that from their own brains, but from seeing the parents value their own screen over time with their child.  So many kids come home to be with a parent constantly on their phone while they need attention.  That?s the new role model, zoning out on TikTok.Worst part?  I?m guilty of it, too.  I?m not as bad as I?ve seen in some of the homes I?ve been in with Early Intervention, but I still catch myself all the time.  At least TV needed to be watched WITH the person, and you could talk about it later or just share the experience"
"My dopamine is screwed and I graduated college in 2009, so I was saved from most of this crap. I can't imagine what its like for them."
"?Personally, I think allowing children unlimited, unsupervised access to technology and the internet is harmful for the developing brain.?I work as a speech pathologist with disabled kids, mostly very severe cases.  I could not agree with this more, particularly for children demonstrating delayed language or social skills.  It?s not noticeable in all kids, but the ones that are delayed are often severely hindered by the constant availability of tech.  I truly wonder what the human interaction is going to be like in 50 years.  If climate change, pandemic, or nuclear war hasn?t gotten us.What a weird time to be alive"
Your post is really difficult to read for someone with ADHD. Consider using multiple paragraphs next time. Meant sincerely!
It?s incredibly hard to control  - especially with the school computers they get that we can?t add any parental controls to.  We?ve tried just about everything we can think of and they still figure out a way to get content.
"Champion comment here. We need to do something. A lot of people feel this way although you said it almost perfectly. There is also science behind it. But as a society we just forget and don?t see it as an immediate concern. The poor kids (us adults too) are suffering from this hyper-digital-media culture and it?s just frying their young brains right out. Not to mention the terrible good-to-bad role model ratio. Like you said, negativity in the limelight."
"I'm sorry, but this comment is so vacuous as to be ridiculous. As the article stated, the problem is not studied enough to have hard numbers, but the roots of most kids mental illnesses stem from poverty, home stress, pre-natal drug use, and broken families, not from Instagram pics. In fact, technology during the pandemic has allowed my kids to stay connected to their peers in ways that would otherwise be impossible. For many kids, it's been a lifeline.People always reach for easy excuses to problems like this because the real roots of our mental health crisis are difficult and expensive to fix. Technology may contribute around the edges of the problem in both good and bad ways, but tossing out the kids' cell phones won't fix a thing."
"I honestly think that extreme inequality also has an impact. Growing up knowing that you?ll probably have to be in the top 25% of earners to be able to afford to do things like buy a house, have a car, save for retirement, etc, means that there?s a lot of pressure on kids to be the best. If you doing super well, there?s intense pressure not to slip and throw everything away. If you aren?t, that?s a catalyst for depression."
Climate change ?
100%. My toddler was in speech therapy starting shortly before age 2 during the pandemic - it was ALL over zoom for an entire year. In what universe do people actually think video conference speech therapy is an appropriate substitute for in person for a toddler?
"As a 16 year old who was doing fine before this happened and then had a sharp decline, thank you! I?ve been gaslighted so many times here because I dare say restrictions made life miserable. I was literally told last year ?at least you?re not living during a war?This comes from a group that claims to care about mental health, and it?s annoying.And I supported all Covid restrictions and vaccinations too."
It?s funny how these people are saying kids staring at their screens is causing them mental health problems when that?s all they can do during online school and staying homeThese are the same people who criticized parents for wanting their kid to play in the park
There is going to be a lot of gaslighting/revisionist history regarding the fact that we destroyed 2-3 years of people?s  young lives.
"I agree with this so much. It?s the same thing with anyone who admits to not liking wearing a mask and wanting to stop. The ?it?s just a piece of cloth? crowd come crawling out of the woodwork to hurl accusations of being anti-mask and to call people whiny babies because they want to be able to see people?s faces when they talk to them. My favorite is when they compare it to wearing pants, as though a huge portion of human communication isn?t done with facial expressions and it?s totally the same thing as covering your fuckin junk. I wore a mask diligently all through the pandemic and I?m enjoying no longer having to do it.Lol at the downvotes on this. Proving my point exactly. Here let me apologize: omg I love wearing a mask! It feels great and is totally not uncomfortable at all and I?m so happy to do it for 10 hours everyday!"
Irony
Says the person on reddit
If only there were some way to prevent breathing in these deadly airborne pathogens in the first place?alas.
Rona would probably just find a different life-long negative outcome for you. Ugh.
Switching from type 2 to type 1 would be pretty devistating.
"That may be a contributing factor. My brother went to get a physical for the first time in years after catching Covid. Thankfully, nothing bad was found."
"I?ve been reading about the increase in type 1 diagnosis after Covid. The virus creates an autoimmune response that kills the beta cells in the pancreas, thus no insulin production and type 1 diabetes.However, this article talks about increase in Type 2 after corona. Maybe it?s both."
It's partisan drama... That's all.
Having deja vu here.
!remindme 6 monthsJust so we can have a reunion and console each other. :(
On top of that they?re vaccinated with Sinovac which has proven ineffective to BA.2 in comparison to the mRNA vaccines
"Every country has to ""pay their dues"" in cases when it comes to Omicron."
"Come on, hundreds of thousands of Chinese civilians may die soon, not something I'd cheer."
What?
"Thanks, I've really enjoyed that you've been doing this. Good bot!"
Great bot!
"I never used to. My reasoning was that I never got the flu, so why would I get the vax? I get the flu shot now."
I know a surprising number of people who are still super sanctimonious about covid precautions and didn?t get their flu shot in 2020 or 2021. Makes zero sense.
This take is the right take. Well said.
"This is the thing, while the measures may be no big deal to many. The effect of not being able to plan anything even weeks into the future because of changing rules etc is seriously downplayed by alot of people.Feels like the last 2 years were just wasted"
"Hilariously many of the measures we instituted in 2020 that didn't work for COVID (like plexiglass barriers, sanitizer everywhere, cloth masks, etc) would actually work really well for the flu. That's where those measures came from, actually - best practice from previous flu outbreaks. (Flu spreads by droplets, not aerosols like COVID)"
We made one strain of the flu pretty much extinct with masking and handwashing efforts to stop covid.
"I?m confused. You think free flu shots?which are already a thing at many community clinics, BTW?would make people take the flu more seriously?"
"I've never had a cold that made me think ""I should go to the ER."" Heck, not even ""Maybe I should see if my doc has any openings in the next few days."" But the flu? Yeah. Once, and never, ever again do I want to go through that."
Holy shit that's 70% less than people with already three doses. Must be something like 95% less than unvaxxed.
I seriously wonder if Israelis are immune to conspiracy theories since so many batshit crazy conspiracies include antisemitism.  Israel has been like a beacon throughout the whole pandemic.
"There are other variables involved here as well. Time since second booster, lifestyle, etc. Like, if most of the 1 booster group were a bunch of party animals, non mask wearers etc and most of the 2 booster group lived secluded lifestyles and were overly cautious, that would skew the numbers. I know the odds of something like that are low, but those types of things have to be taken into account."
I imagine it will also improve the rates for younger people. However they aren't nearly as at risk of dying as older people are. So I doubt it will get recommended for them.
"This is the huge issue. It seems to all be about when you had the last dose, not how many you've had. Can we really do booster shots every 6 months?"
"There's no downside to me for taking a free and effective booster when I can, so I will do so."
"I?d read that even regular flu shots wane in 6 months or so. Part of the reason it?s annual?that and a different flu variant. I got my second booster yesterday, mostly because I?m going to Vegas in 2 weeks.  I?m thinking this will likely be the last one."
"I feel like this has been my question for the past year or so as well.  I mean if I have to get a Covid plus flu shot every year, I?m fine with it, especially if they can pair them up like I did this season."
"We can also make an omicron specific vaccine that is more attuned to the virus and it's mutations, which would hopefully increase efficacy by a moderate degree. Since it looks like future variants are going to be variants of omicron, it makes sense since the current vaccines are based on OG Wuhan variant from three years ago.I think Moderna announced they are working on one last year"
"I got infected six weeks after I got my booster, and all of the news and studies at the time said a booster helped protect against Delta infection but not Omicron so we just got unlucky.   I'm not in high risk situations, I haven't left my house since my booster and got infected by a vaxxed family member I barely interacted with. So I'm not sure what the protection from infection time frame was for me after my booster but it had to have been measured in weeks not months.  Not immunocompromised by the way, just a hermit.  I see no guidance about a timeline for 3 shots + infection to get a second booster either."
"Why not worth it for the rest of us? They are free and safe. Even if you don't die, you are much more likely to have long covid issues if not vaccine protected."
Part of the problem is that they're still giving the same shot that's based on the original wild type virus. It hasn't been updated despite the fact that the virus has been evolving this whole time
I don't know why they don't just open up boosters every 6 months for people who want them. They could even have us pay. There's no massive shortage of vaccines now so it wouldn't affect anyone who needed it.
People forget about long covid. I'd rather have a booster dose each 6 months than having to deal with that shit.
"It seems to be the time since your last shot, not the amount you?ve had."
"It is, the booster's effect fades though, especially in old/vulnerable people, so they benefit from a second booster after a while."
Yes but the 4th booster temporarily increases antibody levels so you might not become infected at all. You can?t die from COVID if you don?t become infected.
"In general yes, if you have a healthy immune system. This study focused exclusively on people over 60 years."
"UKHSA data showed 2 doses as reducing severe disease in breakthroughs about 3-fold, with very little protection against infection.  A third dose brought that to 5-fold, with up to a 4-fold protection against infection.  So that's a combined 20-fold protection from the booster dose versus only 3-fold from the second dose.But the protection against infection wanes with time (indeed the comparison isn't really very good above, since it's comparing recent boosters versus old second doses).  It wanes down to under a 2-fold protection after a few months, and beyond that we don't really know.But since a lot of older people got their third doses a long time ago (in August or even before, for Israel), that's not ideal with cases still being high in many places.  Just bringing the 2-fold back up to a 4-fold is itself a 50% reduction in death.  But it looks like the fourth dose does even more than that.We're getting to really high levels of protection here.  But by comparison, 3 doses was over 99% effective at preventing Delta hospitalizations, with waning being almost too slow to measure.  The level of protection vs Omicron still isn't near that level - and presumably won't be until we have omicron-targeting vaccines."
"> Senior citizens who received a second booster of the Pfizer?BioNTech COVID-19 vaccination had a 78% lower mortality rate from the disease than those who got one only, a study from Israel showed on Sunday.If you are frail and elderly, get another booster.If you are young and healthy, chill out for now.After the 2+1 series, your experience with Covid is most likely going to be similar to any other cold caused by a coronavirus.  Someone who is too frail to survive a cold should get an extra booster."
"Sample size was half a million,  total deaths were 300, 200 from 3 shots and 100ish from 2 boosters. That's a negligible death rate between the two populations anyway[Edit] the people downvoting are ridiculous. Clearly fewer than 1 in 1000 that got the disease died from it in the 60-100 age group.  The difference between the mortality of 2 boosters versus 1 is statistically insignificant.  130 fewer deaths out of 100,000+ population is within error, it is less than .1%58% got 2 boosters, so we will round up to 300000, 92 diedMortality is 92300000 = .00031or .031%230  200,000 = .00115 or .11%Oh yeah,  if we care only about the difference in percentages this looks significant,  but the pure fact that pretty much any confidence level is going to have a margin of errror greater than .1%, this is all insignificantThe conclusion is that a single booster still works"
that was a long time ago
How?
Great point. I think this plays a large factor.
I would guess it would be the other way around - those with health issues that bring covid risk - and those with weaker immune system - will be more likely to rush for a 4th shot than those who feel healthy. For example if you have diabetes you want all the shots you can get.
"I think you are over thinking this. 1. It doesn't make a huge difference anyway. 2. You can get it now then get another later, the shot is pretty safe. 3. Getting Rona later is preferable because better treatments are coming out all the time. Plus the virus is more likely to mutate into a less lethal variant."
Because you're gonna get another booster later. There's no point in not getting one.
"Because it doesn't suddenly drop to zero. And you can get infected even when cases are low in your country, especually with how infectious Omicron is."
"Unfortunately Omicron-specific boosters have shown little improvement over the original shots and most likely won?t be coming to market, at least from Moderna and Pfizer. I think what they?re looking at next are combined boosters with both the original and the Omicron-specific? I could remember that incorrectly."
I know multiple people who have already gotten the fourth shot
"Second paragraph of the article > The country?s largest healthcare provider, Clalit Health Services, said the 40-day study included more than half a million people aged 60 to 100."
That's exactly what was being said about the first booster back in about September - October.
What do you mean?
You can go get another booster anywhere they don?t really care
All those downvotes. How dare he protect others and himself
"Me too. I am not old nor vulnerable, but I would like to take it given the opportunity. I would hate to be sick for two weeks because my university seems to not give a shit about students who test positive."
"See the bottom paragraph of [this post](https://yourlocalepidemiologist.substack.com/p/another-mrna-booster-or-not?s=r):      >I know J&J people are feeling left behind. Data continues to show that a J&J + 1 booster is working as well as the mRNA three dose series. We don?t know why, but there are many hypotheses. For example, the adenovirus biotechnology may lead to greater durability and ?affinity maturation??more sophisticated antibodies over time. Or, this may be a biproduct of mixing vaccine biotechnologies. In short, you do not need a third dose right now. We?re all keeping an eye on the literature."
Thank you.
"Honest question (sorry if it comes across as insensitive), are you old or debilitated? Is taking care of yourself while sick for 1-2 days really that difficult for you where you need someone to take care of you? Is a shot once every YEAR really so frequent for you where it?ll significantly reduce your quality of life?I?d understand if it was once every 3-4 months. But every YEAR is more than reasonable. I get sick after every shot for 48 hours but I gobble up some soup and watch netflix. I never have someone taking care of me."
"Damn, then it's gonna really suck when COVID takes you out of commission for a week instead. And you don't even get to choose which week. Bummer!"
I think it just restores the antibody levels back to what it was after the 3rd shot. The original info about a 4th shot not being any better was referencing a negligible antibody increase over the 3rd shot when comparing similar time after dose.
They did / do but protection dwindles over time.Not sure where it might be any different from a flu vaccine that tons of people get every year
"This study was frail elderly, who we know benefit from boosters for all kinds of things that aren?t an issue for younger people.So far there are no indications that healthy younger people need more Covid boosters."
Could you elaborate?
Completely unnecessary
"Two- yearly shot, seems like. ??"
"Second booster = fourth shot,"
"I'm not used to reading studies, but does this show that there's virtually no increased risk from vaccination? I'm seeing it has the same rate per million as the pre-covid rate."
I think he finds the increased viral load scientifically interesting because it?s already been established that BA.2 is more transmissible than BA.1. So more viral load in the upper respiratory tract that ALSO better infects people. Ooof.
"It's still a good surrogate if you compare like-with-like and early in the infection, not during the recovery phase. No one is going to do 1000s, much less 100,000s, of in vitro infection experiments.Anyway, 2x is not a big difference. Compared to the \~1000x difference between Delta and original strain."
"Not really, it seems to track with the rate of viral replication pretty well. The caveat is that people will often have a low (but nonzero) amount of RNA weeks after infection, but while the RNA is detectable it's also a much smaller amount than when they're actively infectious.Overall, it is a pretty good proxy for amount of infectious virus I'm the upper airway."
"It seems that it will come down to whether or not (or how well) BA.1 protects against BA.2; although the research studies done to this point indicate that it protects [exceptionally well](https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-022-00558-w). If a significant proportion of a population was either exposed to, or infected by BA.1, then BA.2 simply doesn't have the same pool of hosts to try and infect. The end result is a muted or non-existent ""sixth wave"". Although I take issue with calling it a wave before any signs of it having that kind of force in literally any jurisdiction a bit of journalistic license to scare people."
...I mean.....he only is as successful as he is due to his family getting rich off of apartheid......
"That's because he's likely a sociopath, as most billionaires have to be to accumulate that much wealth from the mouths of the poor and hungry in the world."
"One would presume the test is the ""supposed"" evidence"
"He might have worded it that way so you could interpret it like that if you wanted to, but in full context, it seems like he's saying Omicron has changed so much from the original COVID that it should no longer be called COVID. Also dislike that message... Hong Kong data showed BA.2 with similar mortality rate in elderly to original COVID, and significantly higher morbidity in children than original COVID"
>But we?re past the phase of people listening to the government on this.I strongly disagree there - there is a very large part of the population that wouldn't chose on their own to wear a mask but also don't consider it a big deal and would go along with any mandates or even strong recommendations.
Politicians are just  following the science. Political Science in this case.
99 people exercising good hygiene get instantly turned to infected statistics by the one asshole who is sick and not wearing a mask or exercising good hygiene
Wearing a mask is better than sanitizer. Sorry to break it to you
"Not just will, but perhaps legality of the means by which mandates were imposed may be expiring."
That?s exactly it. YOLO
People were complying in NYC. People still wear masks here without a mandate.
You forgot they declared that the monoclonal treatment was declared ineffective against omicron. Non mrna vaccines are less effective as well. Anyway the main point that people forgot is the long covid. Seeing people with just mild symptoms for a few days get that shit makes you think 3 times before considering things safe out of belief.
"We shouldn?t need mandates, but our population acts like petulant children. If they understood that this was about health and had an instinct for self preservation today and when they get older, mandates would not even be a thing. Unfortunately, we live in an idiocracy."
Deaths and hospitalizations are down CURRENTLY. It will likely not stay that way. And long COVID and the strain on our health care system are just as concerning as ppl dying.
"Nobody is against that, people are against blanket mask mandates all day everywhere with no ebd in sight."
"Contrary to what many in Reddit believe, pre-covid, universal mask usage in Asia during seasonal respiratory disease cycles (e.g. flu during the winter) was never a thing. People there have always been more open to wearing masks when they are sick, or when they live with someone vulnerable. And of course, mostly, in cities with high levels of air pollution. But that's it. And people in western countries can do that if they want.But continuous, seasonal mask mandates are losing political viability. Smart politicians can see that. Mask mandates were an instrument to bridge us from a time without vaccine or treatments or general understanding of covid until such things were achieved. That bridge has been crossed and, today, the proper tool to fight covid are vaccines."
"That would be nice, but many Americans will definitely not do that because it?s ?tOo hArD tO bReAtHe? ?iT hOrTs mY eAwS?"
">Because this virus is here to stay, anyone 5+ who wants a vaccine has been eligible to get one for monthsI would also add that 1) Paxlovid is much more readily available than it was even a month ago, in NYC you can have it delivered free to your door and 2) N95 masks are available cheaply everywhere, if you want to wear one no one is stopping you.  The political will for ""mandates"" is gone and isn't coming back."
"deprived of normal schooling' because they have to wear a mask is a bit dramatic.Zoom classes are deprivation of normal schooling, but wearing something extra...? erm..."
I'm calling for masking in schools and don't think mandates should be in place for several more years.
"If only there were some way to know which way things are trending *before* hospitalizations and deaths go up. Wouldn't that be helpful? Bah, probably just crazy talk."
*\*laughs in Long Covid\**
That's really short sighted. Long term effects are going to be crippling with that type of policy.
"My vaxxed and boosted friend ""beat"" COVID in a few days, never being hospitalized.A few months later, this healthy man has diabetes.Long COVID is going to fuck us royally with your attitude."
"My state no longer reports ANY of the numbers, and we went from 7,000 cases a week, to 24,000 cases the following week.I found these numbers from a local newspaper article, so I went to check the very latest figures on the state government's own website, and they were off by a factor of 5 times.Our state only has about 600,000 people, and we rely on tourism to survive. Our borders have only been open for a month, mask mandates ended around the same time. The entire COVID management plan is now non-existant.To put this into perspective, a week ago, infections quadrupled, and no-one is wearing masks where they rightfully should (supermarkets are a prime example). In my area, more than 28% of the adult population has the virus now.:-/"
That?s simply bullshit
Don?t underestimate this virus. I can think of hypotheticals where we would have no choice but have restrictions again. Any variant with high immune escape or that affects children badly instead of the elderly would potentially bring restrictions. I get nervous when people say never only because the virus has been relentless and we still know so little about it.I hope you are right and we stay at where we are now and improve slowly.
"I think it?s been established that pandemic protections need to be established at the local level.I don?t agree with the CDC redefining criteria so that almost all the country was green. National mandates don?t work. I blame the CDC for a huge failure in virtually every aspect of the pandemic. So, I don?t remember where the idea that we don?t need masks came from, but it was a political decision - not a public health decision.Now we have an even more contagious variant, that has higher viral loads, and we are in the same situation as Delta and omicron BA.1 in that we had a lull and failed to prepare.Edit: the only three consistent things have been:1. The vaccines have saved our ass.2. We constantly underestimate this very dangerous virus.3. We learn the wrong lessons from each wave.(4. We will be suffering the fallout from poor public health decisions for decades.)"
Yes
Children under 5 have no vaccine.
"I may have to, because of health problems, if I want a few more years instead of months, but you all do you."
upvote for hilarity
It has nothing toDo with NUC.
He ignored it in Ca. At his Fremont assembly plant. See what the Chinese say about his hesitation to close
No need to drum up reactionaries to counter voters that want to tax oligarchs during a pandemic that benefited monopolies.
What about this is political? The reasons China needs COVID zero are practical.
"I don't buy the argument that the policy is necessarily ""out of date and unachievable"". here's a more eloquent article written by the guardian (https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/mar/28/no-covid-approach-bad-press-but-worked)I think a lot of us are seeing lackluster government responses or inability for the US to culturally embrace a good response as 'the standard' because it hurts our egos to think there can be better. This type of thinking plagues all of our issues, from the possibility of universal healthcare, to voting rights, to climate change, pretty much any ""collective"" problem. Like the article i linked says, it was plan A, and it performed spectacularly. That should be a 'win' column. They *still* have time to enact plan B, especially comparing death rates with other nations - think about that, their plan A was so good, as it's failing they still have time to enact plan B. I also think that people here in the US are incredibly nonsensical. If you want to save lives, then save lives. If it's about the economy, then do what is necessary to save the economy. Fortunately, for a pandemic, to do BOTH, you have to go to covid zero - its the SAME solution. That is how you maximize both goals. *Just do it*. The two-faced arguments in this country was unbelievable -- people who wanted to save the economy was arguing to ignore the virus, not realizing that it would have destroyed our GDP. And if we wanted to save people we should do everything... except to spend money on ventilation standards, domestic mask factories, and robust health care systems. We are *compromised* here in the US, and we keep lying to ourselves by lowering the standards rather than aiming higher."
Sure. But thus far their results have been far fewer deaths and two years of China-sized economic growth expansion. Hard to see it any way other than that they came out ahead.
"Wear one, nobody is stopping you. I'm typing this from a crowded bar full of unmasked people, btw."
"Bold conclusion, I hope its accurate."

You?re my favorite bot. :)
This is going to hurt a lot of people.
I?m right there with you. Somehow our response keeps getting worse.Edit: it?s not ?somehow.? It?s solely due to politicizing the pandemic for gain instead of prioritizing public health in a way that we could be back close to normal now. I don?t see us recovering from 2020-2022 for decades.
Funny how the Senate sees it that way.
For now I have a feeling that with so much focus on the conflict in Ukraine plus the extra refugees Europe may have a surge as well
to be fair adherence to COVID quarantine and vaccine protocols did contribute to the delay in the release of the 3rd season.
Agreed.  A cardiologist suddenly became considered a COVID expert because he got retweeted by the right people.
It's been a hell of a time with a kid born Jan 2020. Anyone else out there with a toddler who's trying to keep them in a bubble knows. I feel like I've been playing pocket Mercy to a Genji for 700 days.
What are those neurological causes? Like what does that entail for the child?
That?s incredible
"What's even more maddening is not knowing whether or not we've already had it. I think since the pandemic started we've been sick around 10 times. Lots of colds, a couple of fevers, myself included. But the rapids always showed negative. However, it also feels statistically unlikely to have avoided the most infectious disease yet have gotten so many others in that span."
"The thing is, we cant do anything about it anymore. The people who?ve wanted vaccines already have gotten it. The rest of the population won?t bother. We?ve been in a pandemic for 2 years. People are tired. We?re tired. We?re tired of living our life in a bubble. You cant prevent a virus like this. No matter how many vaccines you roll out, no matter how much masking you try to do, the virus will never go away. It?ll forever be apart of our lives. If we keep enforcing masks every time there?s a surge, or keep locking down everything, our economy and workforce will be destroyed for an extremely long time."
Good point. We should vaccinate against TB at the same level we are trying to vaccinate against Covid. It?s a pretty regional sickness I think and a lot harder to catch so might be tough to get all countries on board
I wonder why the difference. Maybe a bunch of the population had previous exposure to Covid or the vaccines so it didn?t spread into too many kids?
"Thank you. For the record, I am not a bot nor do I work for the Khmer Times newspaper in any capacity whatsoever."
"By that definition then those who got the Pfizer vaccine would be getting half the dose for it to be a booster. In reality only those who are getting Moderna as a ?booster? are getting a partial dose. Those who get Pfizer as a ?booster? are getting the same exact full dose they did in the primary shots. So really it just depends on what vaccine the person is getting. Those who meet certain criteria of being immunocompromised would actually get a full dose of Moderna instead of the half dose for their 3rd dose as well. Because it can be so confusion depending on the persons specific situation most places probably feel it is just easier to consider anything past the primary 2 shots as a ?booster?, even if it doesn?t meet the definition you described."
Where are you getting your definition? The medical dictionary I use only says ?second shot? with no mention of dose.
Or is this because the story keeps changing?
"When the clinical trials indicate that it has efficacy in that age group.  So far, they've failed to do so."
Seriously. I?ve got to put my kids into preschool and daycare in September and I am freaking out. Clock is ticking for us. I just want them to be safe.
"This is not the same thing. You got a third dose and a booster, this is a second booster."
"This virus seems to mutate too quickly for targeted, variant specific boosters to be an effective option. By the time your omicron booster is ready, omicron will be old news and we?ll be dealing with a new variant. For what it?s worth, the mRNA shots (Pfizer and Moderna) appear to be fairing pretty well against omicron."
"do happen to have mild headaches? not during your mild case, but after"
Thank you for sharing these articles and wearing your mask. Properly fitted masks are underrated during these uncertain times.
Ok good for you
Glad your dad beat the odds. Hooray for science!
"I got covid in early January 2020. When I inevitably wound up in the hospital for treatment of the clots in my lungs, they took a blood draw, and then again a day later because the first set had clotted in the tubes."
Like that one anti vaxxer guy said
do you know where we can read about this ? published papers ? journals ?
"Oh I hear you. It?s so damn frustrating that the onus for public health is now on us as individuals. A few things you can do yourself:1. Wear a well-fitted respirator mask at all times in indoor public spaces, particularly when cases are increasing or high locally2. Physically distance when you are able3. Increase time spent outdoors and in well ventilated spaces with great air filtration4. Stay home when you feel sick (and rapid test early and often if you think you might have the Rona)"
"Vaccines do limit infections, though. Before omicron, they had a huge impact; now it?s a noticeable impact, but not as huge. But they do still have a massive effect on how severe the disease is, and your body?s ability to fight off the disease (because of the vaccine) limits the effects of lingering side effects and other issues."
"What most people do is rationalize or deny furiously. They ignore the problem or even their own worrying symptoms like any other overwhelming problem that they can't deal with thinking about. I'm seeing it constantly with people I know.That being said, any given mild infection is probably not something to panic over if you're boosted. If you don't have concerning symptoms after a month or two you probably came out fairly unscathed. It probably raised your cardiovascular risk some, but probably on the same level as hanging around secondhand smoke. This is where we could use some better, concrete risk numbers instead of sticking our collective heads in the sand. The kicker though is that with Covid making the rounds every 6 months or less, those odds start looking grim in the long run. Every new variant infection dodged matters, and gives your body time to recover, but it's going to be extremely hard to completely avoid it with how things are going."
"Nope. Probably not good. Maybe your friends need to get vaccinated if they haven?t already, and start regularly wearing N95s in public indoor spaces."
I'm not sure if there are any studies that mention that.
"And after reading what you quoted, I'm still wondering ""greater than what"". Greater than... not having it?"
"To greater clarify, the study with veterans showed an increase mostly in hospitalized patients. Very little increase in risk in non hospitalized."
"Scary stuff, which is why I mask up with an N95. Thanks for pulling that together for folks."
I?m assuming you figured this out already but compared to ?placebo/control group? which in this case is ?not covid?.
This is a good question. I?m not sure why you?re being downvoted.
Numerous young people over in r/covidlonghaulers report high heart rate months/year plus after getting covid.
I think it?s just an ad for not getting COVID.
Than anyone imagined a ?respiratory illness? might(Headlines have to be short. That?s why you gotta read the article.)
"The issue is that problems add together.  Bigger problems don't negate smaller problems; rather, having smaller problems at the same time as bigger problems makes them that much worse.The problem isn't solvable though; there's nothing that can be done about it.  It's just going to be another few tens or (Europe-wide) hundreds of thousands of deaths on top of everything else that's going on.   In the meantime anyone in a war or refugee zone who's able to get a vaccine dose should absolutely get one."
"Their priority should be raising money for Ukraine, instead."
Reporting. Thats the key word. Most will take a home test and never report it.
so really he has no clue
I?ve been wondering this exact thing for a good week now. Seems like we?ve been about to surge much much longer than with OG omicron.
"*""No one knows for sure what will happen next, and some experts are somewhat split in their predictions""**?We need a peak and a trough, and we haven?t reached the trough. We keep creating new peaks.?**""U.S. policymakers should focus less on gaming out the pandemic?s timeline and more on promoting things that are proven to work, such as wearing a high-quality mask, improving indoor ventilation, and encouraging people to get vaccinated?including with boosters, which have so far failed to catch on widely in the U.S.""* AND*""It?s too soon to let up on infection-prevention measures.""*Is what sticks out to me the most."
"Testing has also enormously declined during this time, which may be a factor in the rising positivity rate. If the only people getting tested anymore are those who feel sick, positivity rates will inevitably increase."
Not too concerned. That?s baffling.
How are you feeling? I hope it hasn?t been too bad.
Keep in mind hospitalizations and deaths lag a few weeksWell see in late April if it is or isn't bad right now
How could it possibly go well? I mean even a few reasons would suffice. There?s little to no protections in place.
"The Reddit COVID cycle (depending on where we are, it?s one of these answers) 1. Cases are still low 2. Vaccines and boosters are the way out. To hell with the unvaccinated. 3. Masks clearly don?t work if this many cases are being reported. 4. Relax, it?s mild. Just a cold. 5. Only the unvaccinated are dying. 6. Endemic. 7. Its good that it?s spreading, we want a mild variant to spread for herd immunity. 8. Relax, it peaked. 9. No one could?ve predicted this. Just vaccinate and booster. If your under (use whatever age you want. Each wave it seems to trend older and older) you?re good to go. Keep living your life. 10. We need to learn to live with it."
"100%. I still wouldn?t trust them to have regularly changed HEPA filters, though."
"I hope I am wrong, but I don?t see many buildings and businesses?outside of maybe restaurants?implementing these changes when they can just put the onus on us to mask up."
"A year? Shooooooot. We should have started in Jan/Feb 2020.You know, when we didn?t have masks but could have been focused on improving ventilation.F."
"And, ya know, millions of businesses lease their space and can?t just unilaterally update their ventilation systems."
"And they always talk about their ?brave battle?. Not really though, just a long suffocation while they consume 400k-1mil in treatment."
"The descent into tribal divisiveness in the past 5 years has been absolutely astonishing.  It's not the pandemic and it's not just social media.  Really hope people pull their heads out of their ass sometime in the near future, I'm done with it."
"Not sure if they actually have the free vaccine supply for that now. Funding didn?t get renewed, right?"
"Also will it just be for over 50? Or will the usual assortment of ""high risk"" also be approved so you don't get a healthy 50 year old being eligible over a sick 49.5 year old. Or also just the people who want to reduce the chance that their plans get destroyed by catching Covid even if they probably won't get too sick from it."
Israel data?
Wouldn?t conquest be riding around this time as well?
"Often during war most victims die from starvation and diseases, not from bullets. So yes, you should be worried about diseases."
"Refugees may be living in cramped/improvised settings.  Lack of enough sanitary installations (baths, toilets, washing machines), poor garbage recolection, damaged infrastructure and strained health systems are a risk."
Children being injured directly by the fighting and indirectly by the fighting interfering with the medical system are both equally tragic. Why wouldn?t they be? There?s plenty of examples of war zones where disease took as many lives as bullets.
What? Are you inferring its not a bad thing that people in Ukraine now also have to struggle with multiple harmful diseases and try to live homeless with HIV? This post is most definitely not whats out of touch.
"The article mention improper care for people living with HIV, hepatitis C, diabetes and cancer since the infrastructure has been destroyed.  Also risk for outbreaks of tuberculosis, cholera, pneumonia and covid."
"Thank you. The math in this gave me a headache.Btw, I wanted to get a rough sense of how much BA.2 cases were actually increasing. I took the national case count for a week and the CDC estimate for the proportion of BA.2 cases and multiplied those together. Comparing last week and the week before, it looks like it?s actually increasing by about 30% week over week."
God save me from context-free Covid case number reporting. ??
"Too late, just read the comments here. Clickbait strikes again."
This has been a problem the entire time.. specific wording to make headlines sound as scary as possible. Edit problem is most people never read the article and only see the scary headlines
I?ve noticed this has been the move with BA.2 articles lately. Talk about the **huge** increase??.. *in the portion of cases that are BA.2.*
Thanks that title is very misleading otherwise
"The headline isn't misleading, it's not clickbait, it's fucking wrong. Like you're saying, the case *share* has gone up. The wording they used is completely different. But the kind of people looking for the news this headline suggests are going to eat this up."
"Based upon other countries like the UK, cases don?t start increasing until BA2 hits >50% of cases. So I don?t expect numbers to take off just quite yet.>between February 27- March 5, 14.7% of sequenced cases were the BA.2 Yeah they have awhile to go yet. Educated guess I?d say they have a month to go before BA2 hits 50% of cases. But from then on, who knows. Maybe the first wave of Omicron really did cause enough herd resistance."
"I?ve seen online that?s things are very uneven. Ex:  In the UK, hospitalizations are up 20%?but it was pointed out they weren?t differentiating between ?hospitalized WITH Covid? and ?hospitalized DUE TO Covid.?  Big difference.  And that Spain wasn?t seeing an increase in hospitalizations at all.  A lot less uniformity. Could it be vaccination rate?  That Spain had SO many cases early in the pandemic?maybe more natural immunity and/or those most likely to be hospitalized or die already have?  We may never know."
This headline brought to you by Pfizer CEO.
"BA.2 variant cases are not generally reported separately, and so it's hard to tell if it's a concern.The question is how fast the absolute number of cases of the new variant is rising and whether you can treat it as independent of other COVID cases.  If the total cases in LA are flat, that would mean BA.2 is more than doubling each week, and that's pretty bad, even if it's a small number now.  You have to ask whether that exponential growth will continue."
Is anyone really unsure of that?
"This makes me feel that BA.2 won't cause as big of a surge as BA.1 and BA1.1 did. If you look at the chart history, it **very quickly** overtook Delta."
How do you see the full history of the variants on that page instead of the last three months?
Any idea why? I was looking at this earlier too and it seems like per 100k case rate in the US is roughly the same as UK / Europe. Vax rates are higher in Europe fwiw.So why do they have a bunch of BA2 while we don?t?
"Yes, but with the amount of home testing available now cases aren?t quite as likely to surge. People may still be testing positive, but if they?re vaccinated and have minor symptoms, they?ll likely never report their results."
"It wouldn't really start surging until it becomes the dominant strain.But, cases have generally been dropping or staying flat at a low level -- which is expected as BA.2 takes over.The only worrying sign is the infection rate is trending back towards 1 most places in the US, and some places are just getting back over 1. As long as they stay close to 1, that's probably still in the expected range for BA.2. If they keep climbing...that's not so good.But, South Africa never saw a bump, and they've been mainly BA.2 for like 2 months. Netherlands has been trending down for weeks. Germany just started trending down this week. UK is flat/starting to come down. South Korea is finally coming down.This coming week will be important in telling if the US is essentially over the whole omicron wave, or if BA.2 is going to be a problem.And since nothing new has thus far shown up, we might potentially be at the end of the pandemic. (But, it only takes one new variant to pop up to put us right back in.)"
"Add all of that together with the fact that the first BA.2 case was found in the US back in December and I think it?s probably safe to say we will just see a ?wave? and not a ?surge?.There are plenty of people that clamor over these types of headlines, but two years of these headlines and all the time spent on social media really warps peoples sense of reality.Check out r/coronavirusillinois if you want to see some out of touch individuals regarding numbers. There?s a reason that sub has more subscribers than almost any state/country COVID-specific sub."
That is good to here.
"Wastewater surveillance fixes this problem. I wish it was standard in every town/city, and not just for covid. We should be using it to detect all kinds of things."
"Exactly that. They sent all the at home tests to say ""numbers are low, get back to work!"""
"And who cares? Why are we again, making case counts the end all be all? If hospitalizations don?t rise at the same rate then again, why should we care?"
I think unvaxxed people were about twice as likely to test positive and about 10x more likely to get hospitalized during the omicron peak. A lot of vaccinated people (myself included) mysteriously tested negative after being directly exposed to people who tested positive ? probably just because the vaccines were doing their job
"I don't think there are that many unvaxxed people who haven't caught Covid yet, except for maybe some who are ineligible for vaccination and thus have to take extreme measures to shelter (and they'll continue to shelter). I wouldn't expect to see much of a difference in infection rate between vaxxed and unvaxxed at all. Risk of severe disease may still be different though."
Of course it is. The at home testing is to deflate the numbers of actual reporting. The government want this shit done with.
"That's week over week, I believe.week 0: 1week 1: 1.3week 2: 1.3^2 = 1.69week 3: 1.3^2 = 2.197week 4: 1.3^4 = 2.8561week 5: 1.3^5 = 3.71293week 6: 1.3^6 = 4.826809etc.Doubling every 3 weeks is certainly better than doubling every 3 days or every week, but it is still exponential growth. The question is: do hospitalization and fatalities follow the same pattern and for how long will the trend continue?Just a few weeks? Several months?"
It's going in the wrong direction.

Beauty of removing a mandate is that it doesn't make masks illegal.
"Yes, let?s"
Work ?we need to start talking about coming back into the office 100%?*later that day*HR ?out of caution we are informing you a person in the office tested positive for Covid?What a joke. Mask mandate ending =/= Covid is over.
"L.A. resident here - my family is still diligently masking. Haven't had it, don't want it. :P"
Yes just like we have for the last > year?
"My county has a population of ~ a million. 7-day avg 157 cases (total, not incidence rate), hospitals are not stressed, one death in last seven days. So yes, don?t mind if we do."
We aren?t pretending it?s over because it is over
Lol south America is not wealthy and it has more people vaccinated and boosted already than USA. Pandemic is pretty much over in Brazil. Concerts happening and mandate masks being lifted
"That?s great to hear! It?s wonderful when people have positive outcomes after infection! Many people were infected with alpha and delta and were completely asymptomatic! The virus has still killed millions of people though, so personal anecdotes cannot be generally applied."
Shenzhen is down to single-digit cases. Can Shanghai do it too?
"Yep. It's a blatant ""they are superior to you"" double standard applied to health and safety. Crock of horseshit."
"But when the player can?t play, but can sit in the front row without a mask on and watch his team play, that?s just an insane optic.I?m pro vaccine, but it?s just weird looking and hard to justify"
Exactly.
But players from visiting teams didn?t have to be vaccinated. Kylie Irving from the Brooklyn nets could literally sit in the stands right near the court and be permitted to be there but couldn?t play in the game BUT an unvaccinated player from another city could? That?s the law of unintended consequences and it ended up making no sense.
Kyrie was getting way too much attention
The rule was stupid as it is. Like you mention about the workers have to vaccinated but yet unvaccinated players can still go to games and watch their team play court side..So this whole situation didn't make much sense.
Rules for thee and not for me.  What a disgrace.
Or they could just get rid of it for everyone
"There should not be a mandate, and this shows exactly what is wrong with these mandates. Us lower echelon individuals are forced comply or risk getting fired or barred from places, but if you have enough influence you can get your way. This is what all the idiots are rooting for, more government to divide us into ""important"" and ""unimportant"" people."
I bet people stop showing up to games if the vendors and janitors strike.
Visiting players can be unvaccinated so this argument doesn?t apply.
How about no one has to be vaccinated? I'm vaccinated but people shouldnt lose their livelihood because of it.
This only fuels the conspiracy theorist.
"When it was just Kyrie Irving and his fans complaining about the rule and how it affected athletes, the mayor was a tough guy about it and wouldn't back down. As soon as the baseball lockout ended and Hal Steinbrenner and  Steve ""I donated 1.5 million to your campaign"" Cohen came knocking, he changed his tune.The mayor knows who signs his checks."
It should be all
"Not sure what election you were watching, but he seemed like an asshole to plenty of us the whole time, which is why we didn't vote for him."
> he just seems like an assholeHe was a NYPD officer for 20 years.  I'd have been surprised if he wasn't.
I thought that vibe was really apparent in the primary and his skin of his teeth victory suggests a lot of other people did as well. I don't understand what people saw.
I honestly don't see why anyone thought a cop would make a good mayor.
"He's a complete fucking moron, and has been since day 1. Oh I wish to god Kathryn Garcia had won the primary (final runoff was 50.4% vs 49.6%, with ~7,000 votes separating the two). She would have done so much good for the city in her own right, to say nothing of in comparison to Adams."
Can you explain your opposition to this decision?
Should?ve been Kathryn Garcia. Would?ve been good for us and good for her.
[impossible]
"Adams came so close to losing, too. But he'll probably sail to reelection no matter what. Maybe NYC will have a good mayor in the 30s..."
"> There is mass contradictions when it comes to the vaccine requirements and I wish it just sense for everyone.Yeah, make everyone vaccinate. Period."
Not even. This is all about the Yankees
The rule was changed because Baseball is starting. Nobody in New York cares about the Nets.
"Well, if Kyrie was honest about standing in solidarity against mandates for all the people that lost jobs over the mandates, he should still not be playing home games, right?"
"As much as I don?t like Kyrie, I don?t think you can primarily attribute this to him (definitely partially). He?d been sitting for so long and no one was budging?until it was time for baseball to start. The Yankees have a lot of pull and the face of the franchise isn?t vaccinated. I?m sure the Mets also had a Kyrie-level of influence since they have at least one guy who isn?t vaccinated, but I?m pinning this mostly on Aaron Judge and the Yankees. And it disappoints the hell out of me because Judge is so wholesome and beloved and one of my favorite players I?ve ever gotten to watch on my favorite team, who has now revealed himself as a selfish dickbag who CLEARLY knew they?d get the City to break for him because he seemingly had no concerns about not being able to play. Have fun not being able to play any of our games in Toronto, Mr. ?Team Player?."
I?ve seen it described as a legal concern over regulating interstate commerce (if reference to the similar mandate and exemptions in SF).  I think they are afraid to open it up to lawsuits.
"Yes, it's hypocrisy, but that's not how any of the major sports leagues work. What in the world are you talking about in that ""teams won't come?"""
The issue is they already allow unvaccinated players from other teams play and allow unvaccinated fans to site 10 feet away from them. It was pointless to not allow kyrie to play.
r/NBA has had it covered all year
just January?
you must not watch basketball if you somehow missed all the Kyrie anti-vax drama
Sometimes the simple solution is the best solution.
What about the people that got fired over not being vaccinated? Will they be re-hired?
The vaccines don't protect against the current variants. Who cares. It's like getting a swine flu vaccine when the influenza b is running through the community. It's a shame nurses hold opinions beyond the scope of their expertise.
"So say your partisan overlords, well done submitting your free will to them."
Please share with us your findings on the risk this disease poses to professional athletes
Literally nothing. The omicron variant is literally non-lethal.
Because they cannot mandate it for visiting unvaccinated players. It?s a double standard
It has nothing to do with the Nets and everything to do with the Yankees and Mets.
What an idiotic comment
"Literally in Chicago (where I live) there was a very long time (over a year) where you could schedule a health professional to come to your home or anywhere and vaccinate up to 10 individuals. They also gave each person a $100 SNAP (food stamps) gift card to each person. We still never hit 80% vaccination. There is nothing else the government could ever be expected to do. If anyone has any other ideas, share it."
What about boosters? Evidence is showing waning immunity from both second vaccine and third shots. It?s pretty clear we?ll need a fourth shot if we want to avoid future surges.
The remaining unvaccinated will never one. I would guess the exception is if their employer mandates it.
There are no approved vaccines for children under five.
"Well, that's only half-true. I guess a lot of people would want a fourth shot, but can't get any."
Crappy to hear
Boston?
"Never, EVER presume to think the government will give two shits about you or the rest of the ""peasants""."
Like space force
I think it?s RemindMe! 6 months
Idiocracy all the way down
Very wise.
"The article's not about masks or social distancing.It's about the closure of vaccine sites, shortages of 4th boosters and reduced availability of tests in the near future.I'll also add that, due to Congress denying Covid funding extensions, treatment supplies will remain short as well.Even without a new evil variant, it appears our clinical protections are going away."
"This casual acceptance of people dying en masse is half the problem. Socializing isn?t worth human lives, end of."
>Those who are vaccinated are. Those who aren?t are adults who will live or die with their choice. Those who are vaccinated will live or die with their choice too.
"Not everyone feels the need to ""socialize"" that badly. Really hate how we're being forced back to the office with this shitty reason being used."
"> Until there?s a variety that is both more contagious and more severe people aren?t going back to broad restrictions. Yes, people will accept broad restrictions when the situation requires it, and not when it doesn?t. Not sure why that?s a problem?"
"you guys have been saying this since masks came off in february and nothing has come of it. all this article is saying is that we?re getting rid of mass vaccination sites. good, because we don?t need them, you can get them at CVS if you still haven?t gotten one for whatever reason."
"All of them. If we went all-out and hit the virus as hard as we can, we could eliminate it almost completely by starving it out. Isolated pockets would remain, but they could be dealt with in a more targeted manner. Instead, what we?ve done is try to compromise with a deadly virus for two years, and it?s accomplished a whole lot of nothing."
Ever watch the bubble boy movie.
Ah the whole head in the sand approach.
"Uh, ?all the others? are ?free? if you have health insurance or federal- or state-run health coverage."
"As much as I agree that the CDC hasn?t followed the science, I don?t think the CDC?s incompetence is what drove a huge percentage of Americans to distrust scientists.Quick reminder that something like 63% of Americans think Joe Biden is responsible for rising gas prices. I think the problem is just that people are dumb and we need a huge overhaul of our education system."
Proportionately it?s a big increase. Comparing it to the worst of omicron is not that helpful. We hopefully won?t get back there again.
That's a huge increase
This could be the beginning of the surge the UK just had
Good news doesn?t sell.
Well I have some bad news for you; deaths usually come weeks after your first positive covid test. You can see for yourself that the omicron wave caused the second highest waves of deaths in the united states.
"Covid damages the heart, even if you?re asymptomatic unfortunately. I just don?t want to get sick at all, though i fear i already did at one point"
"I keep telling everyone I'm not the problem, my feelings, my depression is normal.  It's this fucked up world that need the help."
Well said.
Agreed.
Maybe the cure is to not pay attention then
"You forgot climate change.I hate this timeline, somebody take me back to 30 years ago."
"And the bad part is that this is true at both sides of the Atlantic. Inflation here in the Netherlands is rampant but we barely see any compensation, or worse: the rich are compensated more than the poor and car owners are compensated at the expense of those using sustainable transit and cyclists. Minimum wages are frozen for 10 years, new student gifts will be the lowest in 15 years, not even taking inflation into account. This while we had to stay home when offices were allowed to be open all along during the pandemic here. Still we were frowned upon every single time we turned the volume up when older generations did the same without being frowned upon. The elderly were in absolute fear about the virus itself while pensions aren't indexed. Generation X escaped all responsibility and does now too as they are the rich car drivers subsidized by cycling students and pension-starved elderly."
Currently don?t feel like I have anything to look forward to any more.
You forgot student loan forgiveness
TrueBut honestly Trump and January 6th were even more damaging to my psycheIt?s not just the pandemic that has been so difficult - it?s been one thing after another
"maybe this is just me projecting negative feelings onto others, but I feel like a lot (a minority by percentage, but like, maybe 20% of the population or so) of people went through the pandemic and out the other side *better* than they went in.lots of members of the pmc got to shift work schedules more to home, saving them gas, giving them more time, etc.low wage workers have gotten so absolutely screwed that it's murderously enraging. How there haven't been more mass shootings and fucking mcdonalds, walmart, amazon warehouses, etc, I'll never know."
"Trauma may also not set in until after the person feels safe. There was some talk about that early on, but not very much and it kinda got swept under the rug. But even if the problem isn't at the level of trauma, you can't just switch it off."
I?m still in survival mode at work. It?s hard to adapt at the moment.
Agreed. There's a bunch of it that's emotional and trauma. But a good percentage of what's going on is also a realization that even during a crisis... maybe even.. *especially* doing a crisis.. the rich just... get richest. It's much more unfair than we ever knew it was possible.
"Might also be the fact that people are realising that their effort could have been in vain with governments opening up too soon, focusing on money over lives"
This
"Everyone I know/know of struggling with depression in the pandemic (distinct from people who are depressed prior to it) had a partner, parent, sibling, cousin or child die of Covid  Some of the worst cases of depression I'm aware of directly infected the loved one who died.   Some of those are children in K-12 who brought it home from school and it orphaned themGrief and guilt are pretty powerful"
I?m really struggling to remember what I used to like to actually DO for hobbies. I remember the person I WAS before and I want that person back?Ironically we caught and recovered from Covid for the first time this last week? but after this upcoming week of sitting around because we can?t go out and risk infecting others I?m just going to throw myself and my family into trying new things.
> Is it okay if I take my mask off to eat? sad
Literally! I thought by the time lockdown was over the virus would?ve been eradicated. It seems like the government wants this pandemic to be ongoing because of how much they?re benefiting from it. Then the amount of people who don?t mind living with an airborne destructive virus is mind blowing.
"Previous post was removed for being purely political, but COVID very early on was highly politicized to begin with. Everything about the election supercharged the negative emotions due to COVID."
"for me, the chief issue is the lack of financial and other forms of support from the government, as well as individual communities."
"I'm part of the reverse group. parts of me sees that these measures are necessary but that everyone's getting tired of it and dropping it. That irrationality due to fatigue scares me. These are protections, we are dropping them as a society instead of working to make them more livable."
"Exactly. The recent studies on masks regarding their efficiency against the latest variants show that individual N95?s provide longer protection (2.5 hours) than universal cloth or surgical mask wearing (30 min-1hr). While it was necessary for everyone to mask for much of the pandemic, that individual N95 protection timeframe suggests it can now be a personal choice in many situations. Yet this new data is ignored by many here. I suspect there is another side to the mental health crisis where certain people are having a hard time with this and are afraid of seeing unmasked faces in public after being told an uncovered face was a source of danger for nearly 2 years."
Lol yeah that just solves everything. /r/thanksimcured

"The same thing was and is happening to me since 2015. Just talking about climate change and climate collapse was bringing so much ugliness out of people. Now, since covid started I just don't talk to anyone - I'm afraid of this hatred and anti intellectualism."
Anti intellectualism went from being a niche to being something populist politicians boost and encourage.In the UK famously during the brexit debate the leave side shutdown all discourse from experts trying to explain that trade is super complicated and good relations with our nearest neighbours is important with a simple phrase People have had enough of experts.A phrase met with cheers by many.

"> since Covid started it became a political issue Can I just point out that using the impersonal voice here makes it sound like this ""just happened"" when in fact> since Covid started it *was made* a political issueThis was done *deliberately*, and it was done in order to sow chaos and division. And it worked."
"Doing what science and the medical community recommends is not political, this is not a both sides issue. One side is rejecting factual reality. It's like global warming.

What the bad part/consequences are though is that it leads to less engagement with the public/non-scientists,  which is what is more and more needed.

The way we avoid vigilante justice in society is by having a functional justice system which holds criminals accountable. We can start with grand juries over mishandling of epidemic prevention policy.
"my company fired all of them, thankfully"
"They take it out on anyone and anything that does anything to make them doubt thier belief that covid isn't serious and they should be taking it seriously.

Seatbelts can't prevent car crashes - they don't have that power.  But if you are in a car crash, seatbelts improve survival odds and reduces the risk serious injury.  Wearing a seatbelt can make the difference between walking away from a car crash or living with life changing injuries such as brain damage or dying. And to push the analogy even more: Not being buckled in endangers others in the car during a crash. Anything ricocheting inside the car is a danger but humans have these big bowling ball heads - which, if flying around - are a danger to other people's skulls."
"We live in a ""postfactual age"" (no idea if I translated this correctly)Many cuts to public education, a political & ideological focus on toxic individuality and the fact, that personal believes can follow the behaviour that would be supported by it.

"There is one simple trick to built trust, it is to be honest and don't try to manipulate, be open about you might be wrong, but you think it is correct. Don't ever ignore peoples worries even if you think they have no merrit."
It?s not straightforward. Are there any long term studies that show that there are no long term side effects?  Just asking questions.
I think the irony of your comment is probably lost on you.
Didn't yall have covid jails?
>Should be a modern country run by modern poeple like Zuck and Besos.It kind of is and that's a lot of why we're in this mess.
Have you seen their education system?
"Because science also say disagreeable things about evolution, reproduction, mysticism (thinking of crystals, auras and the like) and medical guidelines of all types.The article clearly stated it was across the political spectrum."
"I am very low risk.But my parents and in-laws are all in their 60s-70s, and really all of them are pretty healthy and low risk overall except for age. They?re all going to get the second booster. My mother in law is a working nurse so she?s in the hospital every day, but for the rest of the family it?s more of a ?why not? Anything helps? attitude."
Yup. I'll get any booster that's available. I'd be fine with getting it each year like the flu shot.
"I am planning to. I had my booster in November. If/when it becomes available to me I will get it. If it becomes a yearly or every six months thing I will do it because my vaccine side effects have been very mild (mainly just super sore shoulder muscles) compared to what others have experienced, so for me it's not much of an inconvenience. I get a flu vaccine yearly too. I have yet to have covid (or if I had covid, it was asymptomatic)."
"Yes. I figure I'll be exposed and probably infected, sooner or later. I also figure less lasting damage will be done if I have another shot first."
Just got second booster to give my baby some protection before he's born next month.
"I just recently did a platelet donation after a long hiatus during the initial stages of the pandemic. The Red Cross is currently running SARS-CoV-2 antibody testing on all blood product donations.Mine came back ""Reactive+"" which in their parlance means my Ab titers are high enough that they consider my plasma suitable for convalescent plasma donation (to the extent that ever actually happens) despite never (to my knowledge) having actually had COVID. I'm 4+ months out from my booster. Moderna x3.You can donate platelets up to 24x a year. I'm hoping to get back to doing it regularly, and to answer your question, I will probably get a second booster, if approved for 30+ without underlying comorbidities, once that drops."
Yes. Get in my body. I live with 2 at risk people and am in contact with even more. I'll be doing my part for my community and tribe.
Sure. Why not?
"I got booster day after it was available, because Omicron was coming. I've had Vaxzevria and Spikevax, so maybe I'll get Nuvaxovid for 4th shot, so I've got a spread portfolio."
"Probably will get it. I?m relatively healthy and young, but I do have asthma and live with someone who is immunocompromised. There doesn?t seem to be much downside to getting the shot, and enough upside that it would be worth it. It feels like we?ll just be getting a Covid shot regularly from now on, like with the flu shot (which I also get every year for the same reasons)"
"I'm low risk but I'ma still get it. I couldn't live with myself if I got someone's mom or granny sick, a day of joint pain is a small price to pay."
"Yes; don?t worry  about getting sick but if it at all reduces the chance of Long Covid, it?s worth the 24 hours of feeling like ass"
"I'm debating. And i need more expert data. On the one hand, there's patently an improvement in protection, even if slight. The more protection to more people, the sooner this can all be over (spread slows down even more, the hospitalization can drop, so on so forth). On the other hand, it isn't completely necessary. There may be detriments with regard to protection if you overboost with a working immune system. And lastly, we may want to train the immune system to a universal or anti-omicron version of the vaccine (if they come out). It's not clear cut for healthy people at all and its reflected in the talking points of the FDA. We are in the fog of war with this topic."
"No. Every study I?ve seen so far has shown that people like me in their 30s still have adequate protection against hospitalization/death from the first booster, so if I?m going to get another booster any time soon it?s going to because of either some scary new variant takes over or a different vaccine comes out that actually protects against infection better."
"No, most likely not.Considering I?m already vaccinated and boosted, and after previous covid infection and very healthy and in good shape, I don?t really need it.Also my reaction to the third dose was brutal with really high fever. Will recommend the fourth dose to my parents tho. I think it?s generally proven to be safe and makes a lot of sense for those at risk. For me, not so much."
Not unless the guidance changes. I had a ?natural? second booster about three weeks ago so I?m not too worried right now.
"If I become eligible, sure. I wish they would make more effective vaccines but if getting another booster of this kind of vaccines will help me stay out of the hospital, that's enough incentive for me to take it."
"No, I didn't get the 3rd either though. Until a vaccine is created for current strains, or it actually prevents transmission to a high degree, ill stick with my 2 shots. 25 M."
Taking every booster they have!  Must protect nana.  But mostly I?m concerned about the littles who still can?t get vaccinated.
Leaning towards not. I had a terrible reaction to the last one.
"Sure, I'm not in the high risk group for flu anymore, but I still get the flu shot each year.Furthermore, at least my 2 year old can get a flu shot. It's unfortunately imperfect, but staying current on vaccination will always reduce household transmission, as opposed to not being current."
"Absolutely I will. I clean windows for a living, both residential cleaning and commercial, so I'm in the public pretty much 100% of the time. I also don't want to risk giving Covid to a customer/get it from a customer."
God bless you. I can't imagine what you've been through
~6 months
We ?? obviously ?? don't ?? care ?? in ?? this ?? country ?? duh
Need a vaccine with data it's safe and effective for them presumably.
That and wear masks.
"Here in Canada, we were told that COVID was over when 70% of the population was vaccinated. Then it was over when 70% had their first dose and 80% had two doses. Then it was 80% with two doses. Then it was 90% with two doses. Then it was when everyone had a booster. That was the point where people started questioning the narrative with the never-ending shifting of goalposts and the authorities eventually walked back and ended restrictions, including vaccine mandates (with the exception of federal travel regulations). We finished with about 90% of the population fully vaccinated and about half boosted. Yet the COVID lobby, in full panic mode over the return of normality, is now pushing *fourth* shots for everyone? No, I won?t be getting that one. But thanks."
2 weeks to bend the curve.
>Just in time for BA.2. Great timing!Downvoted for spoiling the party. COVID IS OVER OVER OVER OVER OVER STOP TALKING ABOUT IT /s
"Something tells me the parents of the kids that DO die aren't gonna feel too much better when people talk about ""the low death rate in children"" to them......I mean hell, 0.35% of all kids in the USA dying would still be pretty devastating, numbers wise, it would mean \~255 000 deaths."
But it the conclusions hold once reviewed and substantiated... Do we panic then?
"Just now getting over a sinus infection I thought was for sure covid. 4 rapid tests at home starting about 2 days after symptoms, and finally a PCR at the docs office this past Thursday. All negative. To be fair, it could be covid, but it's prevalence is so much lower currently. Could be a simple cold. I've had symptoms for about 6 days now - much better however....."
"Take 2 home tests morning and evening. I was in a similar boat, tested negative on Oct and first home test but positive on the second home test. Then my symptoms got way worse."
"It's definitely possible if not likely that you have COVID. In my bout with Omicron, I had a fever and flulike symptoms for 2.5 days and tested negative during that span. Decided to get tested again after I was starting to feel better just in case... and it came up positive."
"This is anti intellectualism in the US hard at work, these people are trying their darnedest to take over whatever positions of influence that they can"
Immediately thought of the Illinois covid subreddit when I saw this.
"The pfizer doses are all the same, 30 mcg.  Moderna is 100 mcg and 50 for the booster (though some people are still getting the larger 100 mcg dose there).Pfizer and moderna have phase 2/3s of an Omicron-targeting vaccine running.  We have no results, including any phase 1 results even.  I would assume an Omicron booster will be absurdly effective against Omicron once we do begin giving them, but this is months off at best.  Omicron boosters, if they work, would then bring back high sterilization and prevent Omicron spread society-wide for quite some time.At that age I'd probably just get a moderna dose ASAP, but with the uncertainty about future boosters it is a bit of a crapshoot."
"No, there's no evidence that infants get any protection through breast milk.  The milk does contain some antibodies, but that's not absorbed into the bloodstream or in any way able to reach the lungs.  It would help against virus in the gut (Omicron can cause gastrointestinal issues)."
You're fine to go mask free if you're boosted.
"Coronaviruses existed prior to covid 19, it's likely antibodies from another coronavirus"
Cross reactivity from infection with a similar Coronavirus.
"Antigen tests and PCR just look for the presence of bits of the virus.  They can keep showing (almost always weak) positives for some time after recovery.  We have no way to tell if you're actually contagious at this point, however.  By the time the viral load is dropping a lot of it is probably neutralized, so the assumption is that nearly everyone is not contagious."
"I was told specifically not to test by the doh, that I could have a positive for up to 90 days."
"This is not literature but this happened to me. I stopped testing until week 3, after which I tested negative."
This report is Guangdong (shenzhen province) and not Shanghai.
"No, it's just more localized lockdowns rather than whole cities."
After 2+ years but yeah. It's a good start at least
"FOSUN and BioNTech have been seeking approval for the Comirnaty vaccine in mainland China for almost a year, and they still haven't received it."
"In 2021, the CCP ran a pretty hard propaganda against the US created mRNA and J&J vaccines. Their media portrayed them as dangerous with a lot of side effects. Importing those vaccines now would create some major hurdles. The first would be having to walk back all the negative coverage in 2021 and admitting they were wrong, which the CCP will never do. Also, many people would no be suspicious and you'd have to convince them anew that the vaccines are actually good."
"It didn't matter, a lot of people were not wearing masks during Chinese new year families gatherings then after CNY, cases just started to sky rocket.I believe a lot of infections happened when people are at home not wearing masks."
"Masks can't stop spread at home, or in eateries. Doubly so if people are asymptomatic, not even knowing they have it, and hence aren't taking precautions."
Yes. But we?re talking surgical masks or other masks that are not well fitting respirator masks.
"Masks aren?t as effective as a lot of people think, especially against Omicron.  N95s likely work reasonably well provided they are properly used (which is rare), but surgical masks are of dubious efficacy in real world settings and cloth masks are useless."
But it?s not inevitable if one uses the time to get people vaccinated and boosted and improve air quality and ventilation.
So horse-paste (ivermectin) wasn't what we needed.  What we really needed was to shoot ourselves up with llama blood.  I can't wait to see what the anti-vaxxers do with this new info.

There?s no rule against it. Russian propaganda has  done immense harm in the US too. It?s ironic to see the  Facebook posts by anti-vaxxers that are obviously Russian made.The issue with Ukraine is the refuges spreading COVID but it can?t be helped.

"How much are they over there?They are around ?4 here in Ireland, much less in a 10 pack."

"Considering the teacher death tolls I've heard in the south, sometimes the death is very literal"
I imagine it's going to be federally mandated for students in public schools at some point.
It?s not just that. My wife is in sales and her coworker isn?t vaxxed. Many clients require vaccination so she literally can?t go into appointments. It then falls on other people to pick up the slack. It?s bullshit.
Plus the employee loss from people not wanting to work in a Covid unsafe environment.My workplace has kept both vaccine and mask requirements because we have enough people who would quit if they were removed.
"I disagree. In retrospect i totally see what happened. Anti vax employees were stalling like crazy, hoping and waiting for the court cases and the antivirals to be approved. When paxlovid was approved i knew the mandates were dead. It wasn't a perfect drug, but it was perfect for the argument of 'mandates were no longer needed', you can take personal responsibility. on top of that, companies will do the absolute minimum for legal obligation. While the CDC had 'tough rules' the companies played ball - they may have been legally obligated if you got sick during the crisis. The moment CDC relaxed it, they took everything down. Keep in mind, companies have sick time slack, they don't actually care about you specifically. They lowered quarantine time with corporate pressure, it has never completely been about your individual safety. You can be infected, you can be very sick, but the moment you are 'adequate' you are expected back to work. They can handle sick-outs of a certain amount by pressuring existing healthy employees. Which is exactly what they did. Remember what happened to health care workers. No PPE, No relief, No hazard pay, No vacation, Mandatory vaccination, Mandatory reporting. When they need you - they will push you to the limit. When they don't need you, they owe you nothing. Americans need to remember, companies see you as a resource. Do not believe they care about you, do not care about them. Always think decisions from the lens of an executive who thinks you are just a resource to be managed, not that you are human."

Community sounds too much like communist!/s
Vaccines dont stop that.
I 100% agree with it.  They do it with smokers.  Do it with people who refuse to get vaccinated (barring actual legitimate medical reasons).
Long COVID scares me much more than death. Every decent article should mention this in great detail.
"Yeah, dying is shockingly expensive"

">If you think that?ll stop with COVID you?re nutsIt?s not about stopping COVID-19, it?s about preventing hospitalizations.They don?t give a shit if you get sick, they just don?t want to pay for your hospital stay."
They don't want to know more.
"Antiavax propaganda. Lots of it has been traced back to Russia. They use it to desabalize the west. Lots of other reasons too, but this is a big one that not enough people know about."
Unheard yes but not gone. They?ll just move to the same choke point all other vaccines sit on: school and child activity enrollment. Where almost no one thinks about or objects to them. (This assumes that they end up with a long term COVID vaccine and don?t need yearly updates to it like flu.)
"The flu vaccine is a good comparison, though.  There are so many flu strains that the vaccines are ""only"" moderately effective (with no downside).  A lot of people never bothered.  I personally didn't until Swine flu hit, and I the olds were immune because they had antibodies from like 60 years earlier.  Now I think of flu vaccine like pokemon: gotta catch em all.  I know that's not how most people think of it though, it's basically rare for average people to get flu vaccines.The covid vaccines, however, are WAY more effective, both at reducing personal illness and at reducing the spread (contagious time and viral load).  I think there's a very good chance that businesses continue to mandate vaccines, even if for selfish reasons.  No one wants half their workforce out for 2+ weeks during the holiday season, when a shot (or nasal mist, possibly coming soon) will trivially protect them.  Add on the risk to customers, and risk of losing customers to fear of illness, and there's ample reason for businesses to care about getting their workers vaccinated.That said, I fully expect summer to be YOLO unless another strain hits especially hard.  Next winter is likely to be the ""aw shit, here we go again"" moment."
"Well I know where I live, vaccine mandates or proving proof of vaccination is non existent. I'm an adult with no kids in school, so I can't speak to that."
"influenza vaccine, cough cough.kill the old iguess? Way to be you."
Exactly.   Midterm elections are killing the pandemic.  Democrats will be slaughtered if they keep pressing forced medical procedures.
So you are saying covid won?t be seasonal?
"Yes, that's what we need. Insurance companies having even more power over people's health"
You mean the ones that aren t dead or disabled? Because it?s only reasonable to subtract those people that have been harmed long term for their ignorant anti-vaxx beliefs.
"So I'll answer a poster who's post was deleted by Reddit.  He said 'unvaccinated, but prior infection' was vastly inferior to vaccination immunity.  I say see here:[https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/71/wr/mm7104e1.htm](https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/71/wr/mm7104e1.htm)Scroll to the end of the report and look at the big chart.  Find the curve for unvaccinated with prior infection and you'll find it all the way at the bottom, overlaying the line for vaccinated with prior infection and below (better) than vaccination only.IE With prior infection the CDC found your hospitalization risk the same whether or not you vaccinate.  Don't believe me...read the chart.This does not mean you shouldn't vaccinate.  It's the safest way to get immunity.  But it does mean that natural immunity works for those who have it."
Natural immunity isn?t nearly as strong or as long as vaccine and boosters. So why would they count it as being vaccinated. Can you post latest findings?
"I do believe in natural immunity - but so far, there is no way of verifying that someone has already had covid, and which type (because immunity from orior sttains like delta does not makenyou immune from omicron). Until that happens, vaccines are the best way to insure that you have minimal symptoms if you get infected with omicron."
Gee it sure is a good thing the pandemic is over /s
"These aren't translating into more in ICU though - there are currently about 30 in Scotland. Previous wave peaks were 200, 150 and 100.Weekly excess deaths are also at normal pre-pandemic levels, as with the rest of western Europe. Very different in eastern Europe though, where low vax levels mean Omicron is resulting in a lot of deaths.Edit: sorry, written too quickly, meant not ""ICU beds"", but ""ICU vent beds"". In past waves that figure always indicates deaths are going to spike."
Despite vaccinations disease is highest it ever has been and yet people on reddit still jerk how corona is harmless.
"Hopefully a good thing.  Assuming no corresponding proportionate increase in death rate, the omnipotence of a weak strain should ensure the next dominant mutation is more harmless.  Then we really can LIVE with it."

Did you get Paxlovid with a prescription? I?m booking a trip to the UK for May/June and am planning to go to museums and covid makes me nervous given they?ve pulled back restrictions. Aside from wearing a mask not sure what else I can do aside from bring some meds with me in case I get it
">True numbers must be like 90% of UK because no one wears masks and all laws are gone.We have an accurate understanding of what cases are in the UK from the infection survey.If you have a health condition, you should be watching these updates like a hawk.https://www.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/healthandsocialcare/conditionsanddiseases/bulletins/coronaviruscovid19infectionsurveypilot/previousReleasesIn England, the true numbers are 6.39%, not 90% (presumably a little higher now, as there's a couple week delay)*In England, the percentage of people testing positive for coronavirus (COVID-19) continued to increase in the week ending 19 March 2022; we estimate that 3,485,700 people in England had COVID-19 (95% credible interval: 3,387,500 to 3,585,800), equating to 6.39% of the population or around 1 in 16 people.*"
As of end of feb only 50% of the UK had been infected. Probably new infections due to Ba2
"I mean, it looks like many (not all of course) governments are keen on allowing people to party anyway. Some European countries are lifting mask mandates and other restrictions despite rising and record high cases. Ever since Omicron something has changed, I haven?t seen restrictions lifted like this before. With Delta they were primarily lifted when the cases dropped and many European countries and certain counties/states in the US still kept mask mandates."
"I still don't understand why overpopulation isn't the main topic of discussion. This is nature's way of fighting it.Edit: wow didn?t expect this. Oh well, thanks for the replies I?ll read up more about it."
I stopped at the services near Cambridge tonight. It was packed and I was the only person wearing a mask. Not one single other person wearing one
If nobody cares why should the government?I?m not arguing this is *good* but if the people don?t care?ya
Or people just live their life instead of caring about meaningless numbers.
Literally 0 fucks given at this stage. Most people not even bothering to test anymore!
You can relate Einstein?s quote to the exact same thing of restrictions. How many times do we need to take one step forward then one step back?
"Couldnt have said it better myself. As a matter of fact one doesnt need to scroll further than this post for people saying ""but ICU didnt go up"". I even recognize usernames from before delta saying we wouldnt need further NPIs and still using the same arguments nowadays..smh"
"I'm frustrated, but also don't understand how we can get past it. Even if the White House wants to do something, the CDC or congress ties their hands. Obviously we don't know who is controlling whom, we all assumed the White House is pressuring the CDC and the FDA, but then the agencies defy each other on a regular basis over both minutia and major policies (See latest on 4th dose announcements). It's a mess. The vaccines are amazing, we are incredibly lucky to have them. But they aren't perfect since their protectiveness dropped from the original 90+%, and most people in the US are unhealthy and blunts its effectiveness even further (and, obviously the unvax are driving the majority of it). Even if the successive waves get smaller over a long period of time, the sheer number of people getting sick at the same time is going to do economic and health care damage that we all have to pay for. I'm shocked that it's cheaper (politically and economically) to stress our systems than it is to just prevent it from happening."
It?s so fucking frustrating isn?t it!? Total face palm moment every time.
"It was nice knowing nobody, too."
"The way out is ensuring there's enough vaccines, monoclonal antibodies, and antiviral treatments, and that they are easy to get."
Masks and vaccines work incredibly well. What is your source?The US is a terrible example because of the high level of noncompliance.But I thought the UK had higher vaccine compliance?
"It doesn't ""end"". I'm not sure what people expect to happen at this point. This is life now. There was pre covid life and now there is post covid life. Doing anything aside from getting vaccinated when you need to and staying healthy is basically pointless at this point for most people. Restrictions, mandates, etc, it's all meaningless. Covid is here. We're not getting rid of it. We can barely control it. Hope one day we have very successful treatments that are close to a cure. If you want some extra protection wear a mask. if you're very vulnerable alter your life accordingly."
"Uhm..masks work even better against omicron than against delta..https://twitter.com/BagheriMos/status/1482019024678621185?cxt=HHwWgsC4xe2cmJEpAAAA> With masks for Omicron, the upper bound of infection risk is lower than Delta. We assumed that Omicron is three times more infectious than Delta and is mainly in the URT. We ran the same model as for Omicron. [...] To clarify more: risk of infection for Omicron is lower than Delta if EVERYONE is masked (but not zero!) assuming Omicron is really a URT variant (which early data shows to be the case). In any other scenario Omicron risk is higher since it is more infectious. [...]Restrictions also work as has been shown in the doubling rate differences of UK and Germany, 2 days vs almost a week.New vaccines against omicron are in the making and expected in April/May.If you wanna read a bit about what will happen in the long run = epidemicity i wrote a bit about it here: https://old.reddit.com/r/COVID19/comments/r4vboi/weekly_scientific_discussion_thread_november_29/hn6zdrg/The tldr would be that covid is here to stay but in lack of dangerous new variants future waves should remain lower than current ones. People would need shots annualy like against influenza, it is not yet clear when and how recommendations will change between risk groups and healthy people. NPIs would probably be implemented again in autumn but maybe only low restrictive ones like masks vs shutdowns. This is obvioulsy a political question as well but a top virologist explains the medical POV here https://old.reddit.com/r/Coronavirus/comments/tl45jm/berlin_virologist_drosten_high_corona_incidence/> With a view to the summer, Drosten also said: ?And you probably have to control the infection process with relatively mild measures. Masks in rooms are still one of the most efficient means.? However, young people who have been vaccinated three times can move freely again and, in the event of infection, also build up immunity for the community. Long Covid is much less common in vaccinated people.> In preparation for the fall, it must be ensured that effective medication is available for risk patients.> For the winter, the corona expert expects that ?very likely? more severe intervention will have to be made. The current immunity will no longer help against transmission in the fall.> Measures necessary over several years> In general, it will take years to build up community immunity like influenza, Drosten confirmed. One will therefore ?have to control the incidences for years to come with relatively mild measures in autumn and winter?. He did not explain what measures might be necessary.> Booster vaccinations in autumn with a focus on risk groups could also help contain the virus, said the researcher, who is a member of the federal government?s Corona Expert Council."
If you're goal is to never ever get sick then you're only option is to live at home and never leave or interact with anyone.If you're goal is to not get severely sick then get vaccinated and wear a mask when out. The vaccines do work.
"Research and development into treatments needs to be prioritized. The severely ill, especially unvaccinated, will need treatment."
"> Restrictions don't work, masks don't work well enough, vaccines aren't effective enough.Wrong, wrong, and wrong. We have proven that this all works. We just have to KEEP doing it and not remove restrictions/masks the second things get better. We keep doing that and pretend to be surprised when it gets bad again."
"No, it doesn?t. Everybody will get covid in some form at some point, probably numerous times in their lives. If they?re vaccinated or otherwise have some form of baseline immunity, it will be a non-event for most people. Many will likely not even know they had it, as often occurs with the flu. Certain populations who are at high risk will likely be recommended to take some additional precautions during certain times of the year (most probably won?t the further from 2020 we get), and in addition to that baseline level of immunity, antivirals and other therapeutics, which will continue to come out and progress, will be utilized to protect the vulnerable. Yearly shots along with the flu shot are nearly certain to be recommended, at least for most adults."
"Disagree. As both hospitalization and death rates are massively cut via vaccination, it should be treated as similar to the flu very soon. With maybe a slight increase in encouragement of opening some windows during flu seasons."
"Yeah and everything is 10x expensive now , no one can afford kids."
"You're right. In fact, it incentivizes its citizens NOT to have kids."
"On the contrary, the birth rate is negatively correlated with financial independence. The real problem is that there are better things to do, fertility is decreasing along with overall health, and the world is going to shit such that Americans know that for most people here there is a minimal chance that someone born today will have a better life than their parents."
Most jobs too. All perks and incentives are heavily biased towards spending all your time at the job
"Having kids has never been a financial asset (well, at least since child labour isn't a thing anymore) and it never will be. A person's reason to have kids could only come from within, as clich?-esque as that sounds."
"Maine is a great place for climate refugees who don't want to leave the US, but I wouldn't expect them to do a lot of breeding."
Combined with less immigration (which is what was keeping many states from being negative pre-pandemic) and lower birthrates during the pandemic.
"Yes, as the article says;>In that time, nearly 75 percent of all U.S. counties experienced a natural population decrease, compared with 55 percent of all counties in 2020 and 45 percent in 2019, the Census Bureau found. In Maine, Delaware, Rhode Island and New Hampshire, the natural population decrease occurred in every county.Their point is that this metric of deaths versus births has been increasing year by year. 45 -> 55 -> 75/2019 -> 2020 -> 2021. This is significant. This, of course, has to be seen in context such as the fact that the USA has the [*lowest* life expectancy of any OECD country](https://www.healthsystemtracker.org/chart-collection/u-s-life-expectancy-compare-countries/). This gap has been growing since the 1980s. Life expectancy has been basically stagnant since 2014 while that of other countries continued to grow albeit slowly. And then the pandemic hit. No developed country did as poorly as the USA. The OECD average fell by 0.5 years; the American expectancy plummeted 1.8 years, almost 4X that of other comparable countries. The pandemic came to an USA woefully unprepared for such a thing. Naturally there were more deaths, but there was also a previous stagnation when compared to other developed nations. The pandemic shone a light on a long term incapacity."
Basically the world has jumped the shark. Where is the utopia that is handling things better?
Just engage in what aboutisms until you feel good and angry again like the rest of us.
"That migration is certainly happening, as the article mentions, but is isn't significant. Young people aren't exiting 75% of the counties to migrate to 25% and breed like crazy in that 25%. A few facts can be gathered from this link [COVID-19, Declining Birth Rates and International Migration Resulted in Historically Small Population Gains](https://www.census.gov/library/stories/2021/12/us-population-grew-in-2021-slowest-rate-since-founding-of-the-nation.html) from the US Census. First of all the birth rate has been falling steadily since 2007. The death rate has been climbing since 2013. The decline of the one and the increase of the other began to accelerate in 2016, and the level of international migration plummeted drastically in that year as did the composite growth rate. The report from the census emphasizes that this is the lowest growth rate (0.1%) *ever* since the national census began in 1900. Of course demographic decline, lower to negative population growth, is a worldwide phenomenon such that most demographers predict an end to global population growth by the end of the century. The USA isn't yet in a situation of demographic decline such as Germany, Russia , Italy, Japan, Spain, Portugal and many countries in the ex-Soviet empire are. But it will be very soon, probably as early as next year. The response of various governments vary quite a bit. In some nations with traditionally high levels of emigration such as southern Europe or more recent high levels such as the ex-Soviet bloc there is little to be done. People will leave irregardless. There are some things that countries blessed with sane, rational, stable and intelligent governments *can* do. Germany and Japan are good examples. One response is to increase the number of immigrants. Germany has done this across the board. Japan is moving in that direction, but its efforts are heavily weighted towards highly educated immigrants. Both countries aim to make the task of raising a family much easier by a large system of public child care. No doubt there are other policies that don't come immediately to mind. If governments are not rational well then they will continue to hemorrhage population. They may even make the situation worse by policies that make their countries even less attractive to prospective immigrants. I'd say starting a war would be the ultimate stupidity, and we have a good example of that these days. Having a large separate police force dedicated to hunting down non-documented immigrants isn't so bright either, but it isn't on the same level as starting a war."
He?s been here every week since March 2020. He?s incredible.
You can I thought. I got j+j and went in and asked for full moderna and they gave it to me. This was in California at a Vons. I don't know if they were breaking protocol or anything but they didn't even make a deal out of it.
"Just tell them you haven't been vaccinated yet, they don't do rigorous background checks."
Yeah I thought it was insane how me who's immunocompromised was worried about how soon I can get my 3rd primary Moderna shot last summer when the FDA was busy telling those who got J&J that they don't recommend them getting a booster at all.The immunocompromised J&J recipients got royally screwed
I went to walgreens and they didn't hesitate to give me 2 Pfizer.
"Just go get them, you don?t even need an ID to get a vaccine"
"The data on J&J + one mRNA, at least for neutralizing antibody production, is really around the same level as 3 mRNA shots. It's only when you get J&J as a booster to a previous J&J shot that the data are not great."
"Got j&j in june 2021. Got a moderna booster in January 2022. Currently on day 6 quarantine with covid. Not really sick, have the bad cold experience. But it?s starting to feel its taking too long. Should have gotten a full dose instead of a booster dose i guess."
Why can't you? I got the J&J initial dose and boosted with Pfizer this weekend and no one batted an eye. Used the same card and everything.
Collect them all!
"I think you can get one for booster. Not sure if a full series is necessary, cdc might have the data available"
"Some people they are running into clunky, buggy websites from the pharmacy. Pages are not updated or not set up to give fourth vaccines. Some websites are going off of old criteria advice of pre-screener questions (Safeway was not set up for a fourth vaccine and was still asking questions from the last tier.) So then people can't go forward to book an online appointment to begin with because they get screened out or told that there's no appointments available. It's best to use a stock browser that doesn't have any add-ons and allow pop-ups, and update Java and browser etc.The Johnson & Johnson vaccine in some studies has been shown to not be effective against Omicron BA.1 and BA.2. Vaccines can be mixed and matched - if someone had the Johnson & Johnson vaccine they can get a Pfizer booster for example (for the United States anyway, the rules may be different for other countries.)"
... you can just walk into a store pharmacy and ask for pfizer shots....
Who is stopping you?
Agreed. There was recently an article on how J&J vaccine was holding up.
J&J was also generally given to a much younger population. So I?m not sure controlling for variables would make this look much better
"Yes, there is no indication that this is a statistically significant difference."
The J&J was a one shot vaccine because it's phase 1 and 2 trials showed it got a strong immune response after one shot. It may not have been as strong as the mrna shots after two but it was a lot better than the mrna shots after one. And there was a parallel phase 3 two shot trial that went on at the same time as the one shot trial (that took longer obviously). It may or may not have been a mistake to consider one dose to be fully vaccinated but it isn't correct that it was done on an unscientific basis.
"I'm sorry, but this is what's called having an opinion without necessary knowledge.By the same logic, ""Pfizer should have increased the amount of _vaccine_ per does, see Moderna has more per dose! FDA should have told them!""Sorry, but this is ridiculous."
"What that excerpt fails to address, and what has been the central fucking problem during this entire pandemic, is focusing on how your actions benefit yourself rather than how your actions affect everyone, including yourself."
Yup. Same here. Don't care what other people think.
I went maskless in the store the last week for the first time since 2020 and got a nasty head cold as a result that I'm still recovering from. I'll be wearing my mask indoors again just to lower my chances of catching another nasty head cold.
"Yeah, people's resistance to masks has destroyed the last shreds of my faith in humanity.It is SUCH a ridiculously easy thing to do, and yet so many people are so resistant to it. How is your comfort more important than someone else's life?"
You must live in Texas like me??
"Nice anecdote. I'll reply in kind. I have done everything ""wrong,"" including being in close contact with several people who tested positive, for the past two years, and also haven't been sick yet."
They might reduce drag and get better mileage if they remove the flags.
"That?s all good, but in my opinion, using US cases and deaths as a metric to determine the precautions you should take feels imprecise. The US is really big and the situation in Alabama is very different from things in New York City. I would honestly just follow local cases and metrics to determine my risk level."
"I'm right with you. I wouldn't consider going maskless indoors, in public, until the caseload/fatalities dropped to those levels and *stayed* that low (without increasing again) for two or probably more like three weeks. Even if I'm the only one masking, I don't care.. because I'd prefer not to catch OR spread Covid, and masking is the easiest way for me to minimize the chances of catching or spreading while still getting to do plenty of things I both want and need to do!"
"And there is the difference between source control, the reasoning behind collective use of non-respirator masks, and PPE intended to protect the wearer from exposure, like what is used by doctors in COVID wards ever since the beginning of the pandemic."
If only they were cheap and not super annoying to wear
"You can simplify this by refusing to patronize businesses where the employees aren?t wearing masks. If they aren?t doing such a simple and obvious thing to keep people safe, they are probably violating much less obvious things - like health codes for cooking and storing food - without caring either."
Unfortunately it?s not ?your choice alone? since you can spread it easier without a mask. That?s why I don?t go anywhere unless there?s a real need. And I don?t feel like I?m missing anything under the circumstances. The last time I had to go out (12 days ago I think) mine was the only mask in sight. People quit wearing masks where I live over a year ago
"My asthma has improved too, and I never made the possible connection until your comment. Just another reason to keep it on."
Distance doesn?t do much for aerosols that accumulate and linger for hours in an indoor space. If you upgrade your masks that will help much more. r/Masks4All has good info.
"Good news, STDs aren't airborne."
No we shouldn't avoid large crowds
"My favorite direct quote from working at a quarantine hotel, ""I'll be there in an hour or two.  I need to hit the grocery store first"""
I'm sure they'll be another wave but I think we'll see a UK and Denmark situation here in North America where no matter how high they get it or people complain the government just won't do anything and everyone will be on their own this time while it rolls through
"I have already heard people say that they expect an increase I 'flu' cases. 'Flu' cases are already up. Coincidentally, this is the end of seasonal flu season in TX but 'flu' cases are on the rise"
I care.
I don?t believe that for a minute. People care a lot when cases are high
"I don't care anymore. Rather live without restriction, even if it means I die in a month. Not even joking."
I hope you are right!
"Exactly what I thought. Everyone will be confused like ""no one could've seen this coming"""
Oh crap removing all the safe guards and cutting funding to early made another wave hit harder.  Oh well we obviously can only half ass new regulations.  Then we will remove those new half assed regulations before we are below the numbers when the new wave started.
"Yeah, cause it is totally ravaging our population right now."
"The patterns are becoming pretty clear too.  There will be a small bump in April, followed by a massive decline, and then late july/august there will be another wave."
">we will ignore the start of the surge and then act surprised when it happens. I?ve brought up the possibility of future surges affecting my workplace and wanting to be prepared to adjust if need be, to account for it, or just? be aware it *could* affect us, and my supervisor acted almost confused and like it wouldn?t be a problem, surely, even though _**that?s exactly the attitude we had this past winter**_:Despite knowing what was coming, despite me being expected to proactively avoid potential problems in _my_ role, our leadership did precisely zero to prepare and then everyone was surprised when tons of staff were out sick, events got canceled, and morale hit bottom again.I live in an area that gets severe weather regularly. We are taught to be ?weather aware.? This isn?t any different. It?s not a choice between extremes.I?m not even saying it?s going to be a problem, and we all want it to be over and done with; I?m just reeeeaaallly tired of leadership in all domains not being held to the same standard as a lower level employees ? not having proactive measures in place that can be implemented when needed to help proof against major disruptions and mass health issues. I could have used those US gov provided Covid tests back when I couldn?t book a test for days. Those didn?t go out until well after the surge had crested.Instead it?s all reactive all the time and then putting the extra burden on us. Then people quit and it?s even harder. /rant"
"My guess is that cases will trend a lot like they did last spring, when we saw a bump (but not an overwhelming surge) in cases around late-March/April due to reopening and the UK variant, but then a sustained decline during May and June. Who knows what?ll happen after that though. Fortunately, cases in places like New York are still very low compared to what they were like during the initial omicron surge. I don?t think we?ll be seeing any vertical lines"
The cold is harsh!
"At this point it's not stupidity. It willfull ignorance for the sake of ""normalcy""."
"I?m not doing anything different than I?ve been doing. I?m sad to say, I?ve stopped listening to guidance from health officials. They?ve screwed the message on this too hard for me to listen anymore. I still mask up when I?m indoors in public and I still social distance. I?ll also continue to limit activities until my under 5 is vaccinated. I knew we weren?t done after Omicron. Of course there would be another wave. We need to stop acting on predictions and actually get to the point where we actually experience some quiet that lasts for more than 2 months before we declare it?s time to go back to ?normal?.I?m still not convinced we?re at the point of this thing being in the endemic phase and not pandemic. It just doesn?t seem that enough time has passed to say that we?ve stabilized. I guess I just think we need to give this more time to see how it goes. Will hospitalizations stay down? Will time between waves increase? Will they become more localized? We don?t have any of that data yet."
"What do you suggest we do then? Masks forever? I think we are in a better position now than we were in 2020, we have treatments and vaccines readily available. I really do not know what else people want us to do. Covid is not going anywhere and surges will come and go (like omricon).I think we are in the personal responsibility phase. If you feel that strongly then continue to wear your mask, leave the others alone. At the end of the day, if you are fully vaccinated, aren't you protected anyways?"
"Every spring? No, it hasn't. In fact, last spring cases were flat then declined towards the end of spring/beginning of summer."
Yep. After 2 years remote we (fed employees) are being told it?s time to be back in the office.       There will be a 2 week window where I?ll go from not allowed in the office without explicit permission to being expected in the office.
"I'm so tired of the ""experts worry"" headlines. I mean, we're all worried. Does that make it news? Or fact?"
"*Protect yourself and your family and forget about the others*Unfortunately, I work in a service job, so that's not really an option. I'll be exposed to them anyway."
"So then are we just supposed to fear covid forever? I'm triple vaxxed. My parents are triple vaxxed. Everyone close to me is triple vaxxed. I can go get a fourth if I really wanted to right now. What is the end goal you are wanting? Unfortunately, SARS-CoV-2 is here to stay."
"You put ""normal life"" in quotes as if, what, nobody is entitled to a normal life any more?This is just a variant on ""wear a mask or you're literally killing grandma"". It ignores the fact that if people get vaccinated they are at very low risk. Including ""grandma"". At this point if people refuse to get vaccinated they are on their own. I'm not going to stop seeing my friends, family, co-workers, and classmates in person in a normal interpersonal setting because some people refuse to get vaccinated."
*If you want to stay safe protect yourself and your family and forget about the others and let them do their thing. -* spot on with this part
Yeah pretty unfortunate. Just trying to make it to the point these consequences catch up to people and they realize this isn?t going to work.
I honestly don't think it's sad people's risk acceptance got changed. That's just how life works...
"I wonder how seasonal it is. We had peaks and valleys in all different times of the year, in different areas of the world. It seemed to run on its own schedule. I think it is more driven by variant and vaccine than season."
How many waves have we had in two years? What do you think seasonal means?
Not sure why you're getting downvotes. I think people generally agree we need to be perpetually vigilant about covid mitigation efforts in order to avoid surges (which cause us to be hypervigilant during the fall out). We would have a sense of normalcy/stability/freedom if we collectively got our shit together.
Careful your going to get called nasty names for wanting to move on
"In my area (DC metro) it has been mostly normal since Memorial Day last year. Some restrictions here and there but mostly minor like wear a mask for some portion of the time that you are indoors (silly really). We've had family gatherings, dinners, overnight guests, etc. all relatively normal since last summer. The key is that everyone is vaccinated. And we simply got on with our lives. I know one person that got somewhat sick from covid and he had other serious health issues and is fine now.The media talks only about the people that get seriously ill but neglects to mention the millions of people that are doing just fine."
"I must?ve been suuuuper unlucky. I got covid in December 2020, asymptomatic, but I only went to work and the convenience store. I wore a mask, kept ample (or even 8ft) of social distance, held my breath walking by people, etc. no idea where it came from"
"On March 25, 2022, 801 people died from Covid in the U.S. (via The New York Times)  How is this not a deadly virus? These were not all immunocompromised individuals as you suggest. All types of people are still dying. Why is it so awful if people want to be compassionate towards others by using virus mitigating efforts? Aren't all lives valuable?Edited for typo."
China still has no immunity to the omicron variant. As a result they have to keep locking down cities every time they see any cases. And they have to quarantine all of the people coming into their country. Are they going to keep doing this forever?
China is about to be absolutely screwed.  They have a bad vaccine and the virus is breaking out.
Great to see such high vaccination rates amongst the South Koreans!
We did it!
come on. be reasonable. the midterm elections are coming up! political careers are on the line! /s
GOP senators refused to vote for the funding. But go ahead and blame Biden.
27 male.  Chest pain lasting about 3 weeks after the second dose of Moderna.. never got it looked at and it went away... so without a diagnosis will never know but ended up with omicron over the holidays and was sick.  pain after the shot was in the center of my chest between my pecs.
"Anecdotal of course, but my baby had it at 7 months and it was very mild. One day of fever followed by cold symptoms. Hope you all feel better soon!"
I think I?m gonna not take Russell Brand?s advice on health and safety.
Russell Brand says he's not an anti-vaxxer but from what I've seen he definitely pushes a anti-vac's narrative and a lot of the kind of misinformation that goes around and I don't know if it's for views or because he actually doesn't clearly think about everything. Think about it 75 years ago the vaccine for covid didn't exist it was created like 2 years ago. But just like all entertainment online and information online for that matter you got to take it with a grain of salt and think not only of what they're trying to say or highlight but also of other different perspectives.And I like your proactivity on quote on quote before this hits social media and makes the rounds. But this is been making the rounds for quite some time now.
">Can anyone give an objective explanation of what this might be about?Like every conspiracy theory, people are really attracted to feeling special and ""in the know"" about something that most people don't know. Feeling smarter than others is the basis of 95% of the internet! The other 5% is made up statistics. Anytime some random internet person says ""they"" don't want you to know or is ""just asking questions"" your bullshit detector should go into overdrive because it means what they're saying is 99.9999% of the time just bullshit they're using to make you feel special. Because feeling special feels good and will keep you watching and clicking."
"There are a lot of anecdotes of Omicron causing pretty severe early symptoms. It spreads more rapidly than delta in the lungs,  but it's much less able to spread to other organs in the body. Part of it may also be because it's a second exposure and the immune system reacts strongly. Paxlovid may be an option even for low risk people with symptoms that severe.  Though it does need to be started early in disease progression."
Also forgot to add I?ve had 3 vaccinations. Last one in January
"I think you should act as if you have it, isolate, wear masks etc. If its indeed an allergy you wont remember that week of distancing but if its covid you protected others from catching it from you. Take care. https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/if-you-are-sick/index.html"
"A third dose is a very good idea.  Any vaccine is fine but if you're worried about side effects,  Pfizer is a smaller dose. If you're high risk,  Moderna is a larger dose."
"I'd go for another mrna shot if i was you. The reason behind it is this> counts for twobecause in many countries it doesnt. Here in Germany our highest health committee recommends a 3 shot regime for J&J vaccinees. The 1st obviously being the J&J, then a full-mrna shot, then a mrna-booster, which for moderna comes with a lower dose.We also see that the group of J&J vaccinees shows the highest breakthrough infections compared to other vaccinees.> In December 2021, the European Medicines Agency (EMA) approved a second vaccine dose of the COVID-19 Vaccine Janssen for secondary vaccination. However, STIKO still recommends that all persons ? 18 years of age who have received a first vaccine dose of the COVID-19 Vaccine Janssen optimize their primary immunization with a second vaccine dose of an mRNA vaccine. An mRNA vaccine is also recommended for the booster vaccination at least 3 months after the 2nd dose of the basic immunization.

I?m fully vaccinated and boosted. I visit anyone and everyone that I would like and don?t ask them about their vaccination status.
Nuh uh. I don't want the guilt of wondering if I was the asymptomatic person that killed them.
"My family won?t visit them, nor host them in our house ??????? Vulnerable family and strict isolation rules at the workplace mean we don?t take chances."
"I do everything I can to avoid hanging out with unvaxxed people, not because of risk so much but because I just don't like people who are too stupid to get vaccinated and anyone who can't get vaccinated due to medical reasons would probably die if they got exposed to germs from other people in any way."
I visit my friends and family no matter who they are  and what they decided to do in regards to vaccination status
"I figure anytime you're in public then by pure statistical probability I'm surrounded by unvaccinated people anyways, so visiting someone who's unvaccinated wouldn't really make a difference. I say this though as someone who goes to packed indoor unventilated concerts and clubs unmasked.   That said, we did ban any unvaccinated people from our wedding because a) want to at least reduce the odds of getting it for the honeymoon and b) not every vaccinated person is as comfortable as we are with being in crowds and c) helps weed out relatives we didn't want to invite anyways."
"I refuse to hang out with anyone knowingly who doesn?t have any of the vaccines, unless it?s outside and I know the majority of the group is vaccinated and cases are low (had a family member who can?t get vaccinated for health reasons but she had to be there for family portraits)"
I don?t ask or care if they?re vaccinated.
I think you can be together.
"I heard with the omicron variant it's usually about 3 to 5 days but it can be as long as 10 days, while older variants are usually around a week or so."
3-3.5 days average for Omicron.  There's high variation.
"it?s not going away ~~until we make it~~It's never going away, and it will always kill people. We have to manage it now, and we have a lot more to do before it's truly manageable (wider access to tests and treatments, more research into treatments, actually behaving as though we expect another wave will come), but unfortunately, the US government is already dropping the ball on that. I understand your frustration, but we have to let go of the idea that it will ever disappear or stop killing people and work on creating more ways for people to protect themselves. Well, not us personally for that last part. Our personal responsibility as citizens is one thing, but there's not much we can do about broken government policy."
100%
How do we make it go away?
Because the article is about California
That's why a vaccine tailored to Delta would probably be more effective for booster shots.
We haven't abandoned shit yet. April 1st we drop masks. Then you're gonna see sth.
"Germany has a population of 83 million. So 300k its 0,36 %However currently proven infected are 4 million, ever 20th person. With a PCR test positivity rate over 50%, the true numbers should be way above twice that. So its a good estimate that 10%+ are currently sick or asymptomatic."
"If a country just wants to do better than the US has, they have a very good chance of that."
"Indeed. The ?leaders? are still acting like they don?t know what?s going to happen. Reactionary leadership has worked well so far where they claim they couldn?t have foreseen the carnage and then they reluctantly implement restrictions to stem the tide of hospitalizations and deaths (never mind the unknown future number that will end up with long COVID). Even the loudest critics of COVID restrictions e.g indoor masking, limiting indoor numbers, vaccine mandates etc. and proponents of living (and dying) with COVID get drowned out when hospitalizations and deaths hit a certain number.So far, this seems to be the least dangerous political approach and that?s why it will happen over and over again. Public health and pretty much everything else always comes second to politics."
"It's going to be another spring bump.  It won't amount to much, maybe a 50% increase from what we have.  Enjoy the summer because if the pattern holds sometime in late july/august we get to see the whole thing start over again and Herman Cains will start getting handed out again by people still refusing to get 3 shots in their arm."
"Yeah it's peaked in the UK and in Italy, after \~3 weeks of increase. NY is \~2 weeks in, if it peaks in 1-2 weeks it will be a good sign."
"I believe initial data showed little to no benefit from a 4th shot, so Fauci and co were recommending putting it off until there are variant-specific boosters for whatever fun flavor comes out this fall/winter.This is for people who had good responses to the first 3 shots though, immune suppressed may need 4th shots or beyond."
The FDA is meeting next month to discuss 4th doses for the general population.
when did you get boosted?
Judging by the last two years it will happen much sooner than that. It could even occur with the wave we have now entered into. But there will be more before November rolls around. It isn't just the USA. Most countries across the world are in the process of relaxing public health measures. The unspoken ! rationale is that they have decided that a certain number of daily deaths is 'acceptable'. Whether they have to turn on the red light again depends on just how virulent today's and future variants will be.
It's because COVID affects people of the lower economic class more so it's important for the staff to be masked. The famous and rich aren't as susceptible to the risks.
She also responds to average Twitter users who have questions and refuses to get dragged into mudslinging like Angie Rasmussen and Eric feigl ding
"She's continuously downplayed the severity of the ongoing pandemic situation and peddled misinformation multiple times, such as vaccines being 90% effective against blocking Omicron infection. She plays on people who need to hear something hopeful. I can't believe people still take her seriously."
"Most furries (80%+ from the latest survey) are in IT or science related fields. This one specifically is a senior scientist at the Viral Pathogenesis Laboratory in the NIH's Vaccine Research Center (or more simply, they work on covid vaccines)"
"Yeah, if you want to be a reputable source, having a fursona avatar is not the first place I'd go. If it were me, I'd have separate accounts for work and fun."
I don't think the goalposts got moved just because we got lazy. It moved because that's what happened. Variants came out which results in more breakthrough cases. Still fending off severe illness is a great goal as well.
Why is that? Any specific conflict of interest or prior examples of being wrong?
"Probably not. It would likely have some effect even with totally different beta-coronaviruses. Whether the vaccine has some affect or not by itself isn't by itself enough for optimism. If a variant still kills thousands daily. Speaking of those other beta-coronaviruses, if we were to somehow get a variant with a death rate like MERS and as transmissible as BA.2 (with immunity evasion was similar to Omicron was for those infected by previous variants) we'd be in a really bad scenario even if the 3-dose vaccine reduced the rate of death by 80% and everyone was boosted. That could potentially cause 100s of thousands of death every day at the peak. And that would still be a case of vaccines being successful. I'm not suggesting that such a doomday scenario is even remotely likely. Just using it as an extreme example to show the limits of ""well the vaccine still does something"" in judging how dangerous a variant is. Meanwhile, a super-mild variant that causes no long covid that has total vaccine escape could still be less of a burden than any variant that has become dominant."
Yeah scientists are stupid what do they know? I only trust you!!
"Whoa naw, Cobra Commander!"
"It's a strange problem. Policy is they cant do business with tobacco/arms dealers. If they changed the rule in this case, could they be accused of corruption or other legal issues?"
"According to the article, it's a 21% minority stake."
I love the edit lol
The brain fog and memory problems sound like what happens to me when my MS is being a dick.
"Sorry to hear that - it's crazy to think how many people are experiencing the same thing when the main figures being reported are deaths, hospitalization and recovery rates. Strangely enough, I didn't experience any long Covid symptoms after the first time had it, which was quite severe. However I had lingering symptoms the 2nd time I tested positive in which it kinda felt like I had a moderate hangover initially but lost most of my smell and found a lot of the food I enjoyed tasted spoiled or almost metallic taste for 6-8 weeks. It wasn't terrible after initial symptoms but the change weren't subtle. I know everyone has a different experience but to shed some light, the first time was well before vaccines and likely the OG  Covid. The second time was likely the Delta variant and after 1 vaccine (Moderna).I noticed my heart fluttered a lot too but went away after a about 1.5-2 months. I haven't had any negative experiences with the vaccine/booster or have had covid (to my knowledge) since."
"I'm in my 20s too, had Covid in Feb 2020 and I'm still having issues with my memory :( It's a little better now, but the difference is definitely noticeable."
I guess you forgot to put that last part?
What kind of memory issues are you experiencing?
"Damn, man, that's rough. My friend, she's 40, called me in tears, yesterday because of her brain fog. Her bf has a tbi & the way she forgets words, it's kind of similar to how he forgets things. She was sick for like 2.5 weeks but didn't even end up in the hospital (she was close to going, at one point)  & is still having all these issues."
Did you recover your senses and brain fog on your own or did you get the vaccines and that helped you?
Edit: *have
Can I ask you to describe your suppressed breathing? You were able to recover?
"Im the very same. Feb 20 I had it. Still left with inflamed lung tissue, brain fog, memory loss, little sense of taste. Im glad to hear the vaccines are now helping prevent it. It really is quite horrible."
"Out of curiosity, have you tried lion's mane mushroom?"
"Did you ever end up getting vaccinated?  If so, did it help out at all?"
"It's a little early to have data from omicron. We're only about 4 months out from when it first took hold and just over one month out from the peak of the US surge. Most of the people who will have gotten long covid from it aren't even at the 12-week point that a lot of researchers use as their cutoff. Even after a lot of the folks who had omicron reach that point, the data collection, analysis, and writing take a while to get even to the pre-print stage. Gonna be a bit before there are published papers, sadly."
No (which is kind of encouraging seeing Omicron has been around for 4 months now and given so many have been infected).
"Damn, that sucks. How long before your infection did you get your booster?"
"I know the chick that gives the shots at the local CVS here.Shes a hardcore antivax that makes posts alluding to her saving people from the chip every day.Im like 90% convinced the people getting long covid after being boosted were administered their vax by someone ""saving them from the Gates microchip"""
Same here. Week 10. Boosted Nov 24 infected Jan 15.
"I assume you've probably already tried a lot of remedies, but in the off chance you haven't...daily allergy pill? There's some decent studies suggesting the anti-histamine is helping to clear long covid symptoms for some."
"Same. Super mild COVID, only really a sore throat and a slight bit of congestion. But I?m now two months out and still struggling to get out of bed in the morning and make it through the day. And I?m fully vaxxed and boosted. Long COVID sucks."
Can I ask what type of symptoms you're experiencing?
"god speed. I got covid in January due to kiddo after 2 years of being pretty careful. didn't go out and do anything in this time, but kid got it.I still feel like I'm on the verge of needing to use an inhaler all of the time. fully vax'd (booster)"
"This is worrying news. When did you get boosted, and when did you get Covid?"
Sorry . That seems terrible. Twice after vaccinated or twice before vaccinated or a combination? Also are you boosted ?
Side note: I say your username at least twice a day. I have a cat named Taboo and she's very argumentative
"I?ve struggled with energy and other issues ever since getting mono in college (I?m 41 now.  I was hospitalized due to my illness). One big thing that has made my life better has been fasting and daily meditative walks or jogs in the woods.  It?s silly, but I think the old tradition of going to the country when you?re sick is legit.  I hope you?re able to find a way to get your life back."
"Aren't they treating/testing people with long covid using antihistamines?   Not sure which one, but all I remember reading is that it mentioned specific names so it's not any-will-work kind of thing   *family here just got out of covid, out of 6, 1 is showing light symptoms of long covid"
Lowers the risk but doesn't complete get ride of the risk. Hope you get better soon tho.
"Curious?  Did you have any of the risk factors recently implicated in long COVID?  (Diabetes, EBV virus, auto-antibodies, or huge viral load?). https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/study-identifies-those-most-at-risk-of-long-covid#The-4-factors-that-heighten-long-COVID-risk"
It sucks but it could?ve been even worse without the vaccine
They seriously need to create new and more powerful Covid vaccines.
My first vaccine basically gave me what seemed like long covid for a week. It sucked badly. Can't imagine living like that indefinitely. Wouldn't wish it on others.It's like you can function normally but not really.
"Same for me and most of my family/friends who have had covid.All vaccinated + booster but most of us have long covid.I have doubts about this study, I think vaccines just make your symptoms less severe, rather than reduce your chances of getting long covid."
Get new friends.
Side effects from COVID that remain long after the infection is gone.
"I appreciate that, but 'hey it could have been worse' is still kind of a bitter pill and less than sympathetic, especially from a healthcare professional."
Yeah let me chip in! Got vaxxed twice and boosted: no signs of long covid!
Sorry to hear that
"I'm double vaxed . Covid for me was relatively mild , however the after effects have been terrible. I now have an inhaler, I take cold and flu pills daily and I wake a few times a night coughing and struggling to breathe. It's only been a month since I had covid , but my god these long covid symptoms definitely have been the worst part for me . Not to mention lack of taste/smell/appetite"
at this point I don't think anyone's trying to. When they get long-covid they'll just chalk it up to something else.
Might not be related
"According to many of the other anecdotes in this thread you will probably suddenly get long Covid months after your diagnosis. Your symptoms will DEFINITELY be long Covid because there?s simply no other explanation for any ailments, including anxiety?"
how long between your booster and when you got covid?
Symptoms and stuff that last long after you've recovered
And as opposed to what?
Survive COVID and get a blood clot instead. Uhmmm based??
"The substance known as water is wet (when in liquid form), but the word water is not wet unless it is written using a liquid or has a liquid on it.And then there?s steam and ice - as substances, they may be perceived as wet if someone comes into contact with them, but that perception may be because the contact results in some transitioning to liquid form (especially with ice). But as words they follow the exact same rules as the word water, and are only wet if written using liquid or if they have liquid on them.And then there?s the matter of the word wet ? even the word wet is not necessarily wet (to feel) unless it is written with a liquid or has a liquid on it. But at the same time, the word wet is always the word wet, which could be written shorter as just ?wet is wet?. Which also works in the word sense if you say ?water is water? but is *never* true in the word sense if you say ?water is wet? unless you are speaking a language where both concepts are represented by the same word (if such a language exists - does anyone know?)"
I still wear an N95 any time I?m outside of my house or my car.Because I work in a place with hundreds of thousands of visitors per year.  They already give the staff everything from pinkeye to norovirus to every cold virus.  Couple days ago we had a coughing two year old in a stroller in our area for half an hour or so.  One parent looks at the other and says ?Did you make an appointment for her yet?  She?s had that cough and fever since Sunday.?  All unmasked of course.They dropped our mask mandate a few weeks ago.  Myself and ALL my division coworkers still mask all day every day - all of us are boosted and none have gotten covid (except one from a party).I?ll keep my mask on until covid is basically undetected in my region.  Various forms of dementia and cardiovascular issues run in my family - I?m not adding covid on top of that.
"It works, where?s the problem"
"It worked fantastically against the original strain. Evolution happens, and it can happen really fast in a virus that has so many chances to mutate because it has been able to move through billions of people. Being surprised that the vaccine is less effective against today's strain would be like your grandma expecting today's pot to be like the Iowa ditchweed of her youth."
You're on a sub called Coronavirus.
"?Why is you talking about Covid in da Covid sub I walked into, leave Brittney alone?"
I thought I was weird
Nyc cases are increasing pretty signficantly. Too early to see whether or not they will cause another surge like UK is experiencing but it?s likely.
We?ve been trending down every week.
Don't forget many have the free At Home COVID tests so cases are probably higher since those tests aren't reported.
"Those graphs are a little hard to read since you cannot actually see per day numbers. I used the CovidActNow site and its really good for looking at graphs. They Update daily. If you look at LA County, we have actually been trending down the last 2 weeks on a per 100k basis. I did notice that on the link you provided, it does state that it includes ""The case tally includes 123,148 probable cases diagnosed with an antigen test, which return results faster but may be less accurate.""https://covidactnow.org/us/california-ca/county/los_angeles_county/?s=31111950"
"Those cases are a lagging indicator.  It's probably, at this point, more insightful to follow the sewers, as that gives a more current assessment.  LA is back on a slight downtrend."
"Oh stop it already. This is what everyone was leaning on hard when omicron started, 'cases don't matter, it's MILD, only deaths and hospitalizations!!'.We then proceeded to shatter the all time pandemic hospitalization record and match the pre vaccine death peak from the previous winter."
"Case count obviously still matters. Getting infected, even mild infections, can have adverse affects."
"We have been at this for two damn years at this point, how many times must people like you be told that the deaths from covid lag cases by weeks?  If cases were declining in weeks 2 to 4 ago, and only started increasing in the last week, then deaths won't start increasing for another couple of weeks."
"unfortunately, the background of LA County's residents (including multigenerational households, blue-collar work, Hispanic diet, aversion to preventative Western medicine, limited English skills) makes them pre-disposed to risk factors for hospitalization compared to Bay area ppl. Sure, you can say at this point in the pandemic its their own fault. But then you shouldn't complain that mainstream media is trying to educate & advise these at-risk ppl to take more precautions."
Wonder why this is downvoted?  Perhaps because someone wants the government to have permanent emergency powers?
"We mandate indoor masking in my country and we had a huge wave, we had almost a million (confirmed), infections in the oficial count and we are only 3.3 million? and that?s oficial, most people had symptoms and didn?t test. I don?t know if masks made a dent in cases."
"I don?t know how I haven?t gotten it at all. Maybe I have had it and was asymptotic, there?s no way of knowing though"
"I?ve been pro mask mandate throughout this pandemic and have been happy to personally wear one, but, at this point, I agree with you. Mask mandates were beneficial during the thick of the pandemic, but they aren?t a sustainable long-term strategy. I think that anyone who is currently claiming that ?now is not the time to lift mask mandates? should provide a clear and specific exit strategy ? in other words, at what point or under which circumstances, specifically, is it time to remove mask mandates? I feel like there?s always going to be someone out there claiming that it?s too early to remove mask mandates"
"It?s not going away, and while I think people should wear masks especially in crowded areas, less and less people are going to comply as time goes on and mandates will become less and less effective, at the end of the day we can?t make people do anything, and everyone?s just tired. I think it?s good to try to stay safe while we?re still trying to create better treatments and prevention, but we need to learn to live with this because I think it?ll be something like the flu. My problem though with my opinion is immunocompromised people. I understand why people are afraid, if I were immunocompromised, I would be afraid too. I?d feel forgotten, like I didn?t matter. I wish there were a better solution for everyone but right now it?s just hard"
"Mandatory masking should be something that toggles on and off, when needed."
"Whether or not you believe it helped with the spread of covid, masks benefited us in preventing the spread of other diseases as well. People with allergies were also happy for their protection."
"If you breathe, talk, cough, sneeze, any mask is keeping most of your germs to yourself. Even a bad one. Period.If you're talking about a mask on yourself to keep germs out for your own protection, the quality and discipline of mask usage matters a lot and the benefits are situational and nuanced.People conflate these two and overlook the significant benefit of the former while endlessly analyzing and debating the latter. No, even the best masks weren't enough to eradicate covid. That sucks. But yes, any mask is a benefit to public health. Definitively."
"I agree. My relative lives in a rehab type place and they had strict masking rules that helped it not become a death palace, especially before the vaccines. The mask mandates at that place helped save lives.Studies show masks in schools also helped https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/71/wr/mm7110e1.htm to lessen cases so they didn't spread to vulnerable family. Omicron really lessened that I'm sure though.Other than cases in schools and other enclosed environments (like nursing homes) like the article talks about,  it would be almost impossible to compare because of the amount of people who never wore masks, wore them incorrectly, or wore ineffective ones making it extremely hard to have any control over the variables. I have little doubt that it probably helped, especially during the Delta wave, to try and help keep the hospital cases down, but the vaccines helped more. Once Omicron came, a lot of masks were not as effective (but better than nothing), but by then everyone knew that n95's were the best type. It's truly impossible to know how many people were saved from getting sick, but I have no doubt that mask wearing, especially adding it to other things like washing hands, keeping distance/having dividers etc helped.Edit- added link and removed parentheses"
Opposite sides of the same shitty coin
"Unfortunately I have friends like that who hate on people who don?t wear masks. I feel like they do it for woke points but I don?t know and I?m too much of a coward to stand up for them. I?ll keep wearing my mask at school to finish out the school year just because my school has a lot of people so it?s pretty crowded, but at this point, we should just respect what people decide to do. I do think though that we need to have options for immune compromised people so they don?t have to come to school physically and potentially get really sick. The problem right now is that many people want to quit wearing masks, but immune compromised people feel forgotten and like they don?t matter."
"There's almost always a sane explanation for these sort of things, just like how there's usually a good reason that people are wearing a mask by themselves in a car and they don't think that COVID is just going to appear out of nothingness.Some ideas:- They will pull it up if they're talking to someone else who is masked (especially for employees, I've heard of stores that encourage employees to do this).- They're with someone who wants them to wear a mask but not right there with them at that moment.I think it's kinda dumb as well, but it's really unlikely that they think COVID is spread entirely through chin exposure."
"I think the same thing when I see people wearing a low quality cotton mask. Either you care about the protection and wear a high quality mask, or you don't. This middle ground feels performative to me but to each their own."
"People have faces and facial expressions for a reason - communication. It isn't natural to wear a mask all the time, especially if you're not sick."
Yes I hope this spreads to other countries as well.
The article makes the point that the UK is now lumping weekend numbers in with Monday. Is this really a big problem?
"We do not track flu or most other diseases like this. For example, where I live, we count the number of kids hospitalized with flu, and we work with specific labs and healthcare providers to get the number of positive flu tests. But we don?t count every single case, and that is true for many diseases."
Had the same question. We track even non deadly diseases.
"In quebec ( Canada) we stopped testing the general population in december. They only test the medical personnel, people in hospital or nursing home. We have no ideas how many covid cases we have."
"In Spain, authorities have said they're only going to test people over 60 and other vulnerable groups. So I suppose if the rest of us get COVID, they will just not count us."
"I have got to say the amount people here in Brazil are avoiding reality is amazing: we are still on 300 deaths/35k cases on average.  Also another part of the society has been already desensitized about the war, they simply opted to change channels"
In the U.K.  we are peaking and no one knows when the BA.2 will start falling... but deaths are not going wild so everyone is optimistic here for now
">I get it, we all hate Covid-19, but the virus doesn?t care about our fatigueA lot of people, Covid-19 seems to cares about their fatigue and makes sure to turn it up."
Because some corporate bobble-heads are writing the policies.
It?s mostly because some people come in with unknown masks. They may say n95 on them but if they aren?t certified they could be worse than the surgical mask depending on where they got them. A lot of customer sites that I visited had the same requirement. You can always keep your mask on and just put their surgical mask over it.
"Surprisingly, there's some anti mask hospital workers in certain areas of the country."
"Anecdotal: a long time ago, N95s were hard to come by, so wearing one was seen as you basically taking one from a medical professional. My friend, who worked for UCLA Med, was told not to wear an N95 for this reason. The policy was written to ensure that only the medical professionals had the best masks, and wearing an N95 was like showing off."
"Honestly if it's literally possible to follow the government Healthcare regulation, it's not one of the worse Healthcare regulations we have in place."
"If you read some of the linked articles, the hospitals stated that some of the masks were not easily recognized as an official N95 mask, so they offered patients a replacement OR asked them to put the surgical mask over the mask they have on from home."
I think most are just sick of wearing N95s so they assume the patients are too. I always offer my patients a surgical mask because I just figure they?d find it way more comfortable and that?s what we all wear if it?s not a Covid patients. A few say no but most like the  the surgical mask so I keep offering them
"There?s a benefit for everyone. I guess it?s just tough to say that when there are still parts of the world who haven?t gotten the first dose. These epidemiology / vaccine folks are thinking for humankind not US/West-World specifically.That being said, their recommendations should be absolute. Not asterisk?d to protect the rest of the world. In 3 months when they tell people to boost again, the public will be confused as to why the change in recommendation."
"Worldometers is showing a 7-day average of 670, which is a bit short of ""just under"" 1000.If the FDA were to rush approval that would mean a lot more anti-vax sentiment than there already was."
But the study of a 4th dose on young healthcare workers that she cited only showed an [11%-30% efficacy against infection](https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMc2202542) compared to those with 3 doses. Not sure why she doesn't mention that part. And that will probably wane fairly quickly too as protection against infection always has waned faster than expected.So not sure what you're arguing against.
"If you are young and healthy, you don't need it. But talk to your doctor if you're on the fence, they know more than those on the internet"
"It might depend who you are. Older people who are vaccinated are facing worse outcomes than younger people who are vaccinated. Through the pandemic, you'd occasionally see comments from professors who were teaching at universities with no mask mandates. They were vaccinated but still stressed out about their environment and potential for exposure.So, here is a case where a person believes in vaccination, got their vaccines, but are living in a reality where they are facing real health risks. A lot of people would argue we just need to move on, and they should learn to live with it. I'm not sure there's a ""right"" answer, but I do have some pause with a growing general callousness we have towards others these days. The fact is, if everyone in that environment were still wearing high-quality masks even after vaccination, there would be reduced spread/chance of exposure. If it's ""worth it"" becomes subjective, though, and most people have probably already made up their minds how they feel about it. I doubt there will be much convincing from arguing online about it."
Two reasons:1. It indicates a large wave is happening again (including outside Cornell)2. You?re talking about acute risk only. Vaccines appear to to reduce but not eliminate long covid. So there may still be a high morbidity toll from this outbreak
"Couple of things:1) Vaccinated-but-not-boosted is showing *very* poor performance against Omicron&Co.2) Vaccinated-and-boosted are showing excellent protection against death and ICU but only okay-ish protection against infection with Omicron&Co. This number is also dropping fast (as per data released within the last 2 days).3) Omicron&Co are producing frighteningly low antibody response after natural infection. Meaning if you get BA.1 or BA.2 and haven't been vaccinated, having been sick gives you little to no protection against becoming sick again almost immediately. This means that any hope of herd immunity through natural infection is off the table.  Again, that's from new research published this week. It's been a big week for publication.4) High rates of infection within the campus are likely a reflection of high rates of infection *outside* the campus where the vaccination rates aren't as high and so a larger number of people will become seriously sick.5) The *kids* on campus are young enough to be unlikely to end up in the hospital but colleges/universities tend to have nearly as many employees (teachers, janitors, maintenance, services, etc) as they do students and most of those people are older which means more likely to end up in the hospital even if vaccinated.So, is it a big deal? No way to know right now. It's worrying for sure. It's something to avoid just because of the unknown risk. For any more certainty than that, you'll have to look at the hospital stats in 4-5 weeks."
"Cornell started having a spike before a big wave hit last time. I live in the area, staff commutes to work so they have a good chance to bring it with them to other communities. Students go out to other places so staff and other patrons are exposed. Not saying I blame the students for this, but I?ve been watching the county?s daily counts and it?s been increasing. Hell I?m vaccinated and boosted, wore a masks everywhere, and yet my vaccinated husband brought Covid home to share. And I got long Covid out of it that kicks my butt most days and I?m in my early 30s. Something that can cause long term medical issues to someone who caught Covid seems like it might just be a big deal."
"By ""Reddit scientists"" you mean stoners, barflys and Russian misinformation agents right?"
The friends I have that gave birth in crowded hospitals during covid got traumatized pretty bad.
Going to run into a Japan scenario with more older generations and no younger one to take care of.This is going to get interesting.
Not in the US but my wife gave birth to our first kid Early last year and it was difficult. One of the worst parts was me not being able to be there at all and where we live it's common for a 5 day hospital stay afterwards so I got to see my son for 30 minutes the night he was born (this was a kindness extended by nursing staff) and not again until he was 5 days old.
This is happening everywhere. That?s not the explanation. It?s likely tied to rising education rates
"I didn?t really have any strong opinions on having children until the past couple years but I?m going to make it clear to any future partner I?m not interested in having kids. It just seems cruel to birth kids into the world with a seemingly bleak future of possible nuclear wars, impending climate disaster, and further drifts apart in terms of political polarization. Things will have to substantially improve in order for me to be open to it."
I gotta think this is just a temporary short postponement for having kids.  People have wanted to stay away from doctor's offices and hospitals for the last couple years.  It's already evening out.  We can't even get close appointments for doctor and vet visits because so many people have recently opted back in.
"More crazy than the second half of the 20th century, when the entire world was under a constant threat of nuclear annihilation? Or before that, when over 100 million people died of 2 world wars and a global pandemic? Or before that, when political polarization in the USA resulted in a literal civil war with over a million dead? Or maybe you mean the industrial revolution, when kids worked in factories in horrible conditions 14 hours a day? No, you must means it was more sane in the middle ages, when practically everyone was malnourished and majority of children died before the age of 5.The world hasn't gotten tougher. We have gotten soft."
"The irony of this is it is only the smarter people who tend to think this way. Overpopulation is the result of less educated people just doing what comes natural. So your population is still going to increase, but it is going to be populated with far less intelligent people. People are always going to keep having babies, no one is doing the world a favor if they leave it solely up to the uneducated."
"> This world gets more insane by the weekAnd then people say the world was worse before. Lol no, just take the world back to the 80s and 90s and block it there forever. Thank you."
I agreeAt the same time I?m *super* glad I didn?t live in medieval times or earlier
Well not very many people want to live in the nearly 75% of US counties.
Home prices grew less than the growth in the s&p500 and less than the growth in construction material prices.
"Corporate home ownership is a thing.  They swoop in, buy whole developments, and rent it out."
They were already in poverty/homeless?
"Well if you die it?s not like your house just goes up for sale. You can leave it other people if you own it, which many older people do"
Not at all. COVID-19 has also acted as an immigration ban.
You have to remember though that some people wish to have kids one day because they love them and can see themselves being good parents.
Even dying is expensive.
F
Covid has a higher death rate in the US than the Spanish flu
"That was the same for the Black Death too. And even when it ended, birth rates went back up again. Birth rates have always gone up and down throughout history for various reasons. I feel like people have just been forgetting about that."
In this economy and environment!?
But most of those deaths happened people outside what was the US at the time....
When the CDC updates its guidelines.
Came here to say this too. This is just unnecessary fear mongering at this point.
"By extension, this protection from Mtb might explain some of the variation in COVID-19 severity across the globe."
There was a study that did show some protection against Covid-19 in those vaccinated against TB

"I am shocked too.  Also I think we shouldn't have any laws, because I found out rich people get away with breaking them."
"So this part is specifically talking about the T cell reaction to natural infection not vaccine response which is interesting, it says they're currently studying the T cell response to breakthrough infections I'm curious to see what the results are.  Also what is the immune response ""contraction"" and what does that mean if you get infected 2+ times before the T cells can stabilize again at six months."

Thanks!"
"My mouth already tastes awful all the time from bad acid reflux so that would totally be worth it for me. I heard they only give it out to high risk people though so I'm probably fucked, oh well."
"I got the flu on a recent business trip. Was absolutely convinced it was Covid. Nope, the flu. Got my flu shot too, as I do every year. Just unlucky I guess? Kind of funnily like every aspect of this conference was being governed by super-strict protocols around Covid-19 (funnily because they were being so careful about Covid, but it's like everyone forgot other disease exist), and I had to attend virtually from my hotel up the street from the venue because of flu."
"Be careful, I lost my sense of taste for about a week after my symptoms subsided. It was so bizarre but fortunately it came back quickly. My case was very mild. No real fever or cough or anything, more like bad allergies (mild runny nose, needed to clear throat, minor brain fog) and a little tired for a few days. I had in early Jan so assuming omicron as well."
"All I ever hear about online are people who are vaccinated and otherwise healthy (or claim to be,) getting super bad covid but at the same time, everyone I know irl who's gotten covid after being vaccinated was totally fine, even some people I know who are very old and sick, if I were more superstitious, I would assume using reddit deals you 50 hit points of damage or something."
"I had very few side effects from mine-none after the first dose, mild chills and muscles aches and some fatigue after the second dose for about a day or so, and just some muscle aches after the third dose for about a day. Prior to getting mrna vaccines, I legit had no idea people could experience side effects to vaccines aside from allergic reactions because I never had side effects from a vaccine before in my life."
It's really no different from many immunizations.There just isn't a bunch of people whining about tetanus or shingles or... Vaccinations.
"> Could I be naturally immune?> Edit: all vaxxed and boostered, though 5 months ago.This doesnt go well together :DThe vaccines still prevent infections, not as good as against delta but its still significant. Ontop of that masks work better against omicron than against delta. Even with all of that you couldve gotten it asymptomatically and received false negatives on the tests. And despite the high infection rates not everyone gotten it yet. Several weeks ago the WHO estimated infections of about half the population. This means the rest of that will get infected in the upcoming months, relatively few in the summer and more again in autumn, also by then immunity has wane so that more previously infected get infected again.In short: you arent a superhuman and shouldnt write to Charles Xavier. Sorry."
Currently they are the same though they've been testing modified vaccines with sequences that better reflect current variants.
"No. They're all the same. If a better version came out, they'd call it something different."
"I mean, probably. You can see it starting in some places already. Hopefully it will be muted by Spring weather."
It is starting here. And we've greatly reduced testing now that the free home kits (that seldom work for BA2) are available.  It'll be an artificially-muted wave of infections.  Hospitalizations and deaths will tell the tale.
"I am no expert but I?ve followed this all pretty closely and I would be shocked if we don?t end up with annual shot recommendations for most or all adults, probably in the fall coinciding with flu shots (and eventually perhaps being one shot)."
"More and more countries recommend a 2nd booster for at-risk people. Here in Germany for healthcare personnel 6 months after 1st booster (3 months for people above 70 and immunocompromised). But STIKO apprently plans to expand that to at-risk patients as well, meaning comorbidities according to our health minister.France recommends for people above 80 and those living in elderly homes. Australia announced recommendation for people above 65, natives above 50 after 4 months.For the young healthy adult 2nd boosters arent yet recommended, but in many countries your GP can decide to administer it on an idividual basis. The adjusted omicron boosters expected in April/May may change that into a broader recommendation. Plus more data is gathered for recommendations next autumn. Its espected that for such a long time further recommendations will be announced. Its important to note that the only omicron recovered have poor protection for future variants and are strongly recommended to vaccinate."
"Most definitely.  The faster the rate of growth, the faster the rate of decline will be.  And conversely if you flatten the growth, then the decline will be extremely slow too.More technically, if the initial rate of spread is higher, then *at the point when herd immunity is passed* a lot of people will be contagious.  This is true whether the herd immunity point is 50% (R0=2) or 85% (R0=6+).  So from that point you coast much further past herd immunity, leading to a much more rapid decline.  Any susceptible-infected-recovered (SIR) model can show you exact graphs that (in the absence of partial immunity, behavior changes, or population differences) should be pretty good.> It never completely drops off and stays at that level until the next surge. Is this typical of epidemic curves?This is partially caused by heterogeneity, but largely purely coincidence.  The coincidence first: every time cases have gotten low, it's just happened to be right as things change and another variant is rising or seasonality is increasing.More technically, heterogeneity.  Urban areas have much higher initial rates of spread than rural, so (as above) they end up overshooting herd immunity more and ending up with *less* spread after the surge has passed. But in rural areas the curve is different.  The actual epidemic curve is the sum of both of those, so you can end up with a situation where cases are continually dropping in cities but running flat for a longer time in the country.  This is what we are likely to see with BA.2 over the coming months."
Low effort trolling.
Keep walking. Take a mask to pull up and down if you need. But keep moving. Otherwise it won?t be Covid that gets you. ??
"Id go with Biontech/Pfizer for the argumentation of better efficacy that you provided. Also remember to check their other vaccinations, influenza is still a good idea if they havent received their annual yet and Pneumococcus vaccine."
Older people should definitely get mRNA vaccines whenever available.
"You gotta stop worrying yourself (literally) sick over this. You already have a super low chance of reinfection and then on top of that your rapid tests are coming back negative which means there's a very low chance of infection (and an even more lower chance of being contagious even if you were infected).   Odds are if you got a PCR it would be negative, and if it's relatively cheap and you can afford it maybe it'd be worth paying for to make yourself feel better? But I'd be willing to bet you'd just end up in the same panicked state next week the next time you feel randomly tired, so it's probably not going to be a real long-term solution for you. Talk with a therapist or friend about this maybe.   You're doing the right thing to curb the spread, you're testing yourself when you feel off. That's really all anyone can actually do."
"It sounds like you are suffering from the lingering effects of your bout with covid, plus a ton of anxiety. I can totally relate; I have health and anxiety issues as well. Fortunately right now my head is in a good place so I'm doing well. But a year ago I was in a dark place where physical pain, life's harsh realities, and fear /anxiety combined to break me completely. It's been hard but I've grown a lot during the process. Again, it sounds to me as if you should address the anxiety. You're hyper aware of your body right now and you are wanting guaranteed answers. I understand that thought process: you want to be *sure.* Life isn't always that clear. I know that that's incredibly frustrating to an OCD mind, we want answers dammit! But so much surrounding our health and emotions is a mystery. I wish you well! My heart goes out to you - we're fighting the same monster, our own minds!? If you haven't started, I'd suggest a journal. It's a place where you can scream and cry. You can express ANY thought there. It's amazing what you'll write down without intending to. I'm also seeing a counselor. I can tell her anything and that means so much to me. Re-reading your comment, I may have completely missed the mark here, and if I did, I apologize. You asked some specific questions that I can't answer. I hope at least something here is helpful."
"What I don't get is why those families would choose not to vaccinate their elderly members? Even if they don't trust Sinovac, Pfizer has been available for month and months,  but still they don't take it? Hard to blame the HK government when it is individual families who willingly chose not to get the shot."
I know right?  ?????? Does this surprise anyone?
"They were not doing much. They definitely helped, but the overall percentage, considering most kids didn't even use them correctly and were cheap masks, didn't make much of a difference. We know cases will go up and down with our without masks.And we won't be masking forever.."
"And it's not only the kids. Effective masking stops chains of transmission. That protects not only the kids, but also those around then who would benefit from a little less exposure: immunocompromised, vulnerable elderly, unvaccinated under-5's, etc. Every broken chain helps, and that's what the layered approaches are designed to do. Take away the layers and the transmission risk goes up."
Mommy Facebook group backlash
"Additionally today's data on Omicron booster from Moderna show that it worked worse than normal booster, at least in monkeys. It's a day full of good news. :/"
"Please don't kick the automatic buttons to open doors for wheelchair users, it covers them in muck and often breaks them. Wheelchair users don't want whatever is on your shoes on their hands either."
"I've been trying to get out of the habit of opening things with my elbow or sleeve, but I guess I don't have to now!"
"I still let my mail and packages sit for 3 days if possible. Cold viruses live for about 3 days on surfaces, so I figure I'm killing 2 viruses with one stone, hopefully. ??"
"Dude, you should still be washing your hands fairly regularly because even if it had little effect on previous variants, it significantly helped slow the spread of other diseases like the flu. Did you not notice the flu disappear in 2020? It's a disease that spreads through both surfaces and air.Wash hands after going to the bathroom, before eating, and coming home at a minimum. Wipe down high touch surfaces regularly. Especially during flu season. You don't have to go crazy, but it's gross we have to keep telling people this."
"Use all the hand sanitizer, there's even nice scents now. Make sure to moisturize your hands afterwards, though, cracking skin puts you at risk for skin infections."
"The answer is probably ""no one knows"" and ""there are too many variables to test this"" and you can't be sure the viral load will be low enough or that your immune system will react fast enough to avoid the worst."
Oh fucking please be real this time.
"My first thought was that this analogy might work for Thailand (not sure, as I've never been to Bangkok), but it fails for Vietnam.Walking into traffic is what you're supposed to do, even though it's an absolutely harrowing experience for anyone who isn't used to it."
Russian roulette is an apt analogy on the results alone. If you lose you *die*. If you win you don't die. There's no massive gains if you win and no reason to risk your life playing the game at all.
"Even that is a weak analogy.  When figuring your risk you have to take so much more in to account things such as diabetes, obesity, and the rest of the comorbidities."
"Not surprising - if you are spending more time at home, your home matters more to you."
Or nobody wants to be paid peanuts to risk death to work.
Also disabledYou forgot disabled.  Long Covid has quite a few ways to remove them from the workforce
"It's truly that the lower of  birthrates that are the most likely threat to humanity. But to me, all this talk of economics affecting how couples choose to have children is misguided. People in 1600 were far more poor than even the poorest people in Africa today. And they had plenty of children. I think it's just people want the lifestyle of being childless. I'm keeping a close eye on South korea to see what a childless country looks like."
"Think they had more deaths if anything.  Tend to skew older, less healthy, and less vaccinated."
"Yes:""Most participants became infected before COVID-19 vaccines were available in the UK. Some were likely infected by the original SARS-CoV-2 strain but most probably contracted the Alpha variant, according to the authors. How vaccination or different variants such as Delta or Omicron might affect the findings isn?t known."""
"Three doses, got omicron with mild symptoms and subsequently long-covid. Where do I sign up for the study that'll show its happening for the triple vaxxed with mild cases?Acute phase showed no fever, only fatigue, some runny nose and minor coughing... Migrated to lungs anyways.Now my BP is off the charts, d-dimer still positive 6 weeks after acute infection, my platelets are clumping like no ones business, I have extreme fatigue and still coughing up phlegm..."
"Yes this is a new summary of an article already cited.  Again, the AMA apparently considers this study so important that we see it again in a more readable format with a dramatic illustration.   I agree with AMA, these results really are very important and we should take more than a moment to consider the implications."
"While that's true, the changes you get are different. People don't really report memory issues for weeks just because their nose was stuffed up."
"My take home message is:1. We keep up the struggle to protect ourselves from getting it in the first place.2. We keep up the medical science to further mitigate, ameliorate and hopefully eliminate long term negative effects."
Super misleading. Plus excess death still has us severely undercounting coronavirus deaths
"More importantly this change affected the demographic data tracker, but their overall death estimate was still accurate. Those numbers have not changed."
Or CDC audit finds complicated multi state/ county death count 90%+ accurate.
The difference between using death reports and death certificates.
"I suspect that if there's no HUGE rise, it'll be because a crapton of people got infected in the original waves and the pool of uninfected is slim. If there's one thing Americans aren't good at, it's limiting their behaviours lol"
"Nice, and with cases falling, kinda supports that there won't be a surge if it's already dominant."
Source for this?
"Look to see if your geographic region does wastewater testing. Mine does, and the graph is currently showing a curve upward beginning with the same steep slope omicron had in January."
"In the UK they basically have a ""poll"" of people spread around the country who do a covid test every week. Then they use those results to extrapolate how many total cases there probably are in the community."
"My family of 4 all have Covid right now. All did the home test. We're quarantined, but our numbers won't ever be reflected in any data."
I self reported and I also reported my son?s positive tests.
"Who would you report them to? I mean if I had a home test and it was positive, I?d contact my doctor for advice. But are GPs reporting cases from positive home tests?"
"Well, I'm just happy that worldwide daily deaths are the lowest they've been since March 2020 (Average of 4700 a day). I guess it's combo of enough people getting vaccinated, the virus mutating into not affecting lungs as much, and the new medications that are coming out to help people recover quicker."
Or just track percent positive.  If it's rising there's going to be case growth.
"I have a strong suspicion that weather patterns make a huge difference - the US is huge enough to have multiple climates, where the UK has cold&humid or cold&wet without pretty much anything in between (current London heatwave aside)"
"I think its likely we'll see a heafty spike in the next few weeks, like Europe has, but it won't be as bad as the Omicron surge in December/January.But I'm not an expert"
Long covid is not all good at all
What about long COVID?
"Yeah I keep checking every morning how many covid cases in the states there are, and it just keeps going down"
"The tipping point seems to be 50%. I?ve been doing some rough estimations in a spreadsheet. Basically, if it wasn?t for BA.2, cases would be falling by about 30% week over week and if we just had BA.2, cases would be increasing week over week by about 30%. The reason why cases are falling overall is because, right now, there are less BA.2 cases than other cases. Basically, the increase in BA.2 cases are more than cancelled out by the drop in other cases. But that stops being the case once there are about as many BA.2 cases as other cases. At that point, cases will stay the same and if the BA.2 cases outnumber the other cases, you would expect to see cases rise again."
"Well, it is technically the next Omicron, because it IS omicron."
The article right below this one on the sub currently says it's unwise to have your attitude. You might want to read through it. https://www.reddit.com/r/Coronavirus/comments/tkr5dl/long_covid_could_create_a_generation_affected_by/
But not everyone is vaccinated. Can't we keep taking precautions until kids have a little protection?
I am hearing and seeing literally zero of this chatter (and I?m in NYC).  What happened at the beginning of Omicron - EVERYONE was talking about it. I'm seeing little to nothing outside of Asia and parts of Europe.Care to share some examples?
"Everyone is testing at home and not reporting those positive tests. Leads to a false sense of security because the ""official"" numbers look low when they actually aren't. Had two coworkers test positive at home last week, and our numbers are VERY ""low"" here. I luckily managed to avoid it."
Anecdote
"Same here, in the past 2 days I've seen 5 people I know post about how they caught COVID.  These are all pretty careful people.  Felt the same way a few months ago during Omicron.  Seems like something is happening."
It?s all from the EU
He has been full of hopium. I hope it works out for him.

It?s already been in the US
"Omicron is ~30% less severe than Delta, and about 50% more severe than the original."
>but Fauci doesn?t expect another surgeIt?s right there in the headline.
Are you an epidemiologist?
"Well... It is a cousin, so..."
"We had the same freedoms when I was growing up, it was just that the morons back then felt outnumbered and were capable of being embarrassed into silence. Now that the internet has given them a community of dipshit solidarity we've lost a valuable safeguard. We need to figure out how to make these folks capable of shame and embarrassment again."
"I mean, you literally can fix stupid. It's called education."
"Actually there should be multiple fact checking sites, that are independent."
"Perfectly put.Not only that, but support was also reduced to the most vulnerable in our society."
There should've been greater emphasis on masking and ventilation
We should ban alcohol! Deciding for others what risk is and isn't acceptable is so hot right now.
Or it's just because of covid. living with thehigher possibility of death or long term disability as your constant companion is stressful.
"There?s been a radical increase in substance abuse deaths starting prior to covid.  Adding 10 to 15k a year hasn?t been atypical.  Sounds like they are saying adding about 18k new deaths in Covid year to the under 65 population?  And 74k Covid deaths. Totaling all substance abuse vs Covid and it?s more of a threat (assuming our level of Covid intervention, since unfettered Covid should exponentially increase Covid death rates).  I believe malignant neoplasms and unintentional injuries remain the top 2 for under 65.Covid deaths are infectious disease and substance abuse deaths are a person using substances.  We tend to activate more to help on issues entirely out of a persons control.https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/products/databriefs/db329.htmhttps://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/68/wr/mm6833a5.htm"
Gyms aren?t necessary. Exercise is but gyms aren?t.
Well Austria did learn how to stack deaths in 2020 from Sweden. But that's a different story. Btw the swedish charade is not over look at the death numbers and infections the numbers even with a time delay so not match at all. By death numbers they should have had roughly 25.000 infections per day 3-4 weeks ago. Austria again is following Sweden in is this regard ATM by test and isolation reduction. It is not applied yet but will soon....
Have you heard what?s happening in China?
"They didn?t get to the point of releasing actual numbers because they weren?t good enough to do so, they went back and added a third dose with data expected in the next month now."
They didn?t publish their results publicly
We're actively studying efficacy of BNT162b2 on 12-17 year olds at the clinical research site I work at. The protocol looks at efficacy and safety of 10 mcg vs 30 mcg dose whilst paying attention to any incidence of cardiac issues.Edit: added BNT162b2
"I think that timeline is a bit off.  The submission of data should be in 2-3 weeks.  After that, FDA has taken on average 1-2 weeks to deliberate, IIRC.  Doses would be available soon after that.  Assuming the two dose regiment is 28 days apart, that timeline is more like approval 3rd week of April and first shots in arm end of April, second shots, end of May, fully vaxxed Mid June."
I'm seeing from Instagram @dr.rishahoshino who is a pediatrician that she is expecting mid april for the first shots.
"Thank you for this. Wayyyyy later than I was hoping for the time line. Ughhhhhh.EDIT: she has posted again and estimates earlier. She is no expert, so take with a grain of salt. ?I messed up on this! I should?ve used 4w because it?s from submission rather than 6w from data???? ?? shots mid May and fully vaxxed by July 4th ?? ?????7:04 AM  Mar 23, 2022I?m sure we will see other estimates around today. Please post what you find!Estimates:@MamaWeasleyy mid May first shots, fully vaxxed 4th July@dr.rishahoshino- pediatrician she is expecting mid april for the first shots."
Sure would be nice if the vaccine approval boards moved with the urgency for this age group that they did for adults.
Why are they waiting until mid April to apply?!! How about today?!! We?ve been so long without any shots for this age group.
I mean who is MamaWeasleyy and why do we care what she thinks?

My son turns 6 months in June. ?????? This is amazing.
"Damn, that's amazing. Rush emergency approval to get fully vaccinated during low spread season, have efficacy wane by peak season, push to sell more boosters to kids."
"Im confused too- one article said those percentages were for symptomatic infection, another said infection in general. Those are two very different things. Anyone know which one?"
"For two shots, it's pretty low.  Adult course now is a booster, which they indicated theyre already moving on to studying for kids too."
"These vaccines were designed for Alpha, Omicron and the newer variants are so different from the original strain that it doesn't work as well. This is why dropping all mitigation measures is idiotic."
"I think that may be against infection from Omicron. Severe illness and hospitalization continues to be far higher, thankfully. Too bad the CDC dropped mask recommendations."
"What you said is incorrect. The dose used for adults is not the same as what they've been testing on kids in different age groups. Also, no one said anything about about efficacy dropping in the adult population."
